In the past five years, research has shifted from traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) , including multimodality, for data augmentation to enhance generalization, and combat overfitting in training deep convolutional neural networks. However, while existing surveys predominantly focus on ML and DL techniques or limited modalities (text or images), a gap remains in addressing the latest advancements and multi-modal applications of LLM-based methods. This survey fills that gap by exploring recent literature utilizing multimodal LLMs to augment image, text, and audio data, offering a comprehensive understanding of these processes. We outlined various methods employed in the LLM-based image, text and speech augmentation, and discussed the limitations identified in current approaches. Additionally, we identified potential solutions to these limitations from the literature to enhance the efficacy of data augmentation practices using multimodal LLMs. This survey serves as a foundation for future research, aiming to refine and expand the use of multimodal LLMs in enhancing dataset quality and diversity for deep learning applications.

#### 1 Introduction

Data augmentation is a fundamental technique in machine learning (ML) that enhances the size and diversity of training datasets through the generation of modified versions of existing data samples [\[1,](#page-37-0) [2\]](#page-37-1). This practice uses various transformation functions (TFs), methods like rotating images or changing words, that adjust the original data to produce new variations, as illustrated in Figure [1.](#page-1-0) Data manipulation experts applied these TFs manually to generate new examples that help train deep learning models more effectively. Specifically, TFs such as image rotation, gaussian blur, zooming in/out (Figure [1\)](#page-1-0) could transform a single image of apples from orchards into multiple orientations, effectively increasing the dataset size for models focused on image processing. Similar TFs for text and audio data, like random insertion and specific audio modifications, broaden datasets for natural language processing (NLP) and audio analysis applications, respectively [\[3,](#page-37-2) [4\]](#page-37-3). These augmentation strategies not only increase the volume of data available for training but also introduce a spectrum of variations that models might encounter in real-world scenarios, thereby enhancing their robustness and generalization capabilities. This foundational practice is depicted through a visual representation in Figure [1](#page-1-0) a, showcasing the augmentation of image data with rotated apple images as an example.

Traditionally, data augmentation was performed manually, but with the advent of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,it has become a more automated and widespread practice [\[5,](#page-37-4) [6\]](#page-37-5). LSTMs facilitate the automatic generation of synthetic data across various applications, including time series forecasting, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity recognition[\[7\]](#page-37-6).

shift reduced the reliance on manual data creation, as illustrated in Figure [1](#page-1-0) (b), which depicts the transition to LSTM-based data augmentation.

The LSTM-based augmentation became a cornerstone in data-driven fields until the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI. With the surge in popularity following innovations like ChatGPT, LLMs have begun to redefine data augmentation, particularly by integrating and automating cross-modal synthesis. As shown in Figure [1](#page-1-0) (c), this new era leverages the contextual intelligence of multi-modal LLMs to perform data augmentation. These methods also move beyond traditional and LSTM-based methods by providing more sophisticated, contextually aware synthetic data generation across multiple data types.

Data augmentation is crucial for enhancing the robustness and performance of DL models across various domains such as computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition. In computer vision, techniques like random cropping and flipping are normally used to prevent overfitting by promoting generalization across different orientations and expressions [\[8\]](#page-37-7). Similarly, in NLP, synonym replacement and paraphrasing help models to generalize across diverse lexical and linguistic formulations, crucial for applications like sentiment analysis and chatbot interactions [\[2,](#page-37-1) [9\]](#page-37-8). In the realm of speech recognition, strategies such as noise injection enable models to perform reliably in noisy environments by simulating various acoustic scenarios [\[10,](#page-37-9) [11\]](#page-37-10).

Data augmentation enables model training under varied conditions, like lighting in autonomous driving or medical scenarios in imaging, reducing reliance on costly data collection.[\[12](#page-37-11)[–15\]](#page-37-12). It also addresses class imbalance and enhances dataset diversity, which is important for tasks requiring high levels of accuracy in real-world setting, such as machine translation and sound identification [\[16,](#page-37-13) [17\]](#page-37-14). Data augmentation synthetically increases training data, reducing costs, speeding development, and maximizing data resource ROI [\[2,](#page-37-1) [18\]](#page-37-15).

Building on the existing foundation of data augmentation methods, the advent of multi-modal LLMs has brought a lot of changes in the field. These models go beyond traditional applications such as machine translation and sentiment analysis, introducingpseudo data generation for classification and dataset enhancement for regression analysis [\[19,](#page-37-16) [20\]](#page-37-17). This shift introduces a transition to more dynamic and functional data augmentation techniques that not only diversify available methods but also deepen our understanding model training and performance [\[21\]](#page-38-0).

Necessity of this survey While numerous review articles on data augmentation in AI research have explored various techniques, most focus on traditional ML and DL approaches [\[4–](#page-37-3)[6,](#page-37-5) [8,](#page-37-7) [15,](#page-37-12) [18,](#page-37-15) [22–](#page-38-1)[30\]](#page-38-2), including GAN-based methods [\[14,](#page-37-18) [31](#page-38-3)[–33\]](#page-38-4). However, these studies often focus on a single modality, such as NLP or image processing. This survey addresses the gap by exploring ML and DL techniques across three modalities, Image, Text, and Speech, while also covering the latest advancements in LLMs and generative AI methods. This survey critically evaluates the diverse methodologies for data augmentation that have emerged over the past five years. In particular, with the rapid advancements and capabilities of LLMs from 2020 to the present, significant transitions in these methods have taken place. We, particularly, focus on the application of multimodal LLMs in data augmentation in generating coherent and contextually relevant synthetic data.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>3 Background

### 3.1 Historical Context

Data augmentation has undergone significant evolution since the 1990s, as depicted in the upper part of Figure [3,](#page-6-0) where traditional methods are highlighted in blue, red, and green boxes representing image, text, and speech augmentation respectively. Initially, these traditional techniques, such as image flipping, rotating, and scaling, were employed to enhance dataset variability and robustness. Entering the 2010s, a shift occurred towards more sophisticated ML and DLapproaches, illustrated in the lower part of Figure [3.](#page-6-0) These ML and DL methods introduced advanced, automated augmentation processes tailored to specific modalities, significantly improving the creation of diverse, realistic datasets that closely mimic real-world complexity. This section provides an overview of the progression from traditional to ML/DL-based data augmentation, setting the stage for our exploration and analysis of multimodal LLM-based data augmentation methods from 2020 onwards.

## 3.2 Traditional Data Augmentation Methods (1990-2010)

• Image Data Augmentation: Traditional image augmentation methods from the 1990s to early 2000s primarily used geometric and color transformations to enhance ML training datasets, as shown in Figure [3](#page-6-0) [\[36,](#page-38-7) [37\]](#page-38-8). These methods improved image quality and interpretability by overcoming the limitations of then-current imaging technology with several innovative techniques. Histogram hyperbolization was introduced to enhance contrast more effectively than standard methods by applying a memory-less nonlinear transformation tailored to human brightness perception [\[38\]](#page-38-9). Additionally, non-recursive techniques that utilizes local statistics were developed for noise filtering and contrast enhancement, ideal for

real-time applications [\[39\]](#page-38-10). Other techniques, such as included local histogram equalization and dynamic video gain adjustment for enhancing TV-type imagery in varying lighting [\[40\]](#page-38-11), shock filters based on nonlinear differential equations for reducing oscillations and enhancing feature recognition [\[41\]](#page-38-12), and fuzzy set theory to improve image clarity and contrast by manipulating pixel properties [\[42\]](#page-38-13).

Traditional image data augmentation methods, while pioneering for their time, had limitations that could compromise the effectiveness of augmented datasets. Techniques such as image rotation and flipping were straightforward and computationally light, helping to enhance dataset size and variability, but often at the cost of losing important data or introducing artifacts like empty corners or misleading features for asymmetrical objects [\[43\]](#page-38-14). Scaling images to simulate depth perception proved useful for creating scale-invariant models; however, this often led to pixelation and resolution loss when images were enlarged [\[44,](#page-38-15) [45\]](#page-38-16). Color jittering adjusted images to simulate different lighting conditions, but excessive alteration could render images unnatural [\[46\]](#page-38-17). Similarly, cropping and Gaussian blurring were employed to focus model attention and simulate blur effects respectively, yet these could remove vital image details or overly simplify textures, potentially undermining model training [\[47–](#page-39-0)[49\]](#page-39-1).

- Text Data Augmentation: Traditional text data augmentation methods, uch as synonym replacement, random deletion, random insertion, back translation and random swapm have been typically used in the training of language models by introducing lexical and structural diversity. Synonym replacement allows for the substitution of words with their synonyms, which helps models in grasping semantic similarities [\[50,](#page-39-2) [51\]](#page-39-3). However, these replacements are sometimes contextually inappropriate, as synonym databases may not capture nuanced meanings or colloquialisms, which occasionally alter intended sentiments or textual nuances [\[50–](#page-39-2)[52\]](#page-39-4). Random Deletion methods that removes words to mimic incomplete information, compelling models to deduce missing context, though excessive use risked omitting essential information and skewing data representation [\[53](#page-39-5)[–56\]](#page-39-6). Random Insertion is employed to enhance model robustness by inserting random words into unpredictable positions within the text. This method aims to prepare models for handling unexpected or out-of-context inputs. However, it compromises grammatical integrity and adding irrelevant content, which could muddy the training process [\[57,](#page-39-7) [58\]](#page-39-8). Back Translation is another traditional method to translate sentences into a foreign language and then back to the original language, resulting in subtly different paraphrases. This process was dependent on the quality of the translation systems and was noted for being both time-intensive and computationally demanding, especially for longer texts or rarer languages [\[59](#page-39-9)[–63\]](#page-39-10). Random Swap reorganized words within sentences to reduce the model's sensitivity to specific word order, benefiting languages with flexible syntax. However, this could also disrupt the natural flow of text and complicate the learning of language rules [\[58,](#page-39-8) [64\]](#page-39-11). Some of the popular text data augmentation methods during the 1990 to early 2000 are illustrated in upper mid part of Figure [3.](#page-6-0)
- Speech Data Augmentation: Traditional methods of speech data augmentation have been typicall used for auditory experiences across various applications since the early 1990s. Early studies like Cohen (1993) introduced augmented audio reality by merging computer-generated sounds with natural environments, enhancing telepresence and virtual reality interactions [\[65\]](#page-39-12). Other contributions include Brandenburg et al. (1992), who used autogenous fat for vocal cord augmentation, showing improvements in voice quality [\[66\]](#page-39-13), and Watanabe (1985), who enhanced teleconferencing systems by integrating audio and visual information [\[67\]](#page-39-14).

Schmandt (1990) also incorporated speech input into window systems, facilitating voicecontrolled navigation [\[68\]](#page-39-15), and Adams (1992) utilized the Lombard effect to increase voice intensity in Parkinson's patients [\[69\]](#page-39-16).

Challanges: These pioneering methods, while useful, face challanges such as alignment accuracy in synthetic audio with real-world environments, vulnerability to background noise, and substantial computational demands for real-time processing. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, techniques like noise injection, pitch shifting, and dynamic range compression were developed to train robust audio recognition systems capable of operating under varied real-world conditions [\[70](#page-39-17)[–72\]](#page-39-18). However, these methods often introduced artifacts, distorted audio signals, or overfitting to specific noise types, highlighting a persistent need for improvement in simulating authentic auditory environments for deep learning applications [\[72–](#page-39-18)[74\]](#page-40-0).

#### 3.3 Machine Learning and Deep Learning-based Data Augmentation (2010-2020)

• Image Data Augmentation: Over the past decade, DL/ML based image data augmentation techniques including the methods like rotations, flips, and crops (Figure [3\)](#page-6-0) have been extensively used to train neural networks to be invariant to changes in object orientation, scale, and position, essential in sectors such as medical imaging [\[15,](#page-37-12) [75,](#page-40-1) [76\]](#page-40-2) and autonomous driving [\[13,](#page-37-19) [77\]](#page-40-3). Advanced techniques have also emerged to handle increased task complexity. For instance, elastic deformations and affine transformations including scaling, shearing, and translating are employed to mimic real-world variations and perspective changes. Techniques like Gaussian blur and perspective transformations enhance model tolerance to sensor imperfections and variable viewpoints, while patch shuffling and methods such as cutout or random erasing challenge models by altering image contexts, compelling reliance on less obvious features for predictions [\[22,](#page-38-1) [78\]](#page-40-4).

Additionally, innovative augmentation methods have driven substantial progress in fields requiring complex visual processing. MixUp technique blends images and labels to prevent overfitting by diluting pattern recognition, whereas style transfer and GANs generate stylistically varied or completely synthetic images to enrich training datasets, addressing issues like data scarcity and class imbalance [\[79,](#page-40-5) [80\]](#page-40-6). These methods have found applications beyond traditional realms, enhancing video data robustness in surveillance, adjusting images in agriculture to predict crop health under varied conditions [\[22,](#page-38-1) [78\]](#page-40-4), and creating realistic patient data in healthcare for better disease prediction models [\[81–](#page-40-7)[83\]](#page-40-8).

Challenges:However, despite these advances, challenges persist such as potential image quality degradation from techniques like rotation or scaling [\[4,](#page-37-3) [84\]](#page-40-9), which can detrimentally affect training outcomes. Additionally, the complexity of generating sufficiently diverse images that accurately reflect real-world variability necessitates the use of resource-intensive generative models, highlighting the need for continued innovation in augmentation technology [\[85\]](#page-40-10).

• Text Data Augmentation: From 2010 to 2020, the integration of ML/DL techniques advanced text data augmentation to a great extent. These methods are used to refine the processes that enhance text-based applications like machine translation, information retrieval [\[7,](#page-37-6) [27\]](#page-38-18). The most famous DL/ML based text augmentation methods are illustrated in Figure [3.](#page-6-0) The period was marked by the application of statistical methods to linguistic databases, greatly improving the handling of textual data [\[86\]](#page-40-11). For instance, early work by Fung in 1994, which augmented Chinese dictionaries with statistically collected character groups from corpora, significantly expanded domain-specific and regional word coverage, thereby enhancing natural language applications by enriching the lexicon with words, idioms, and technical compounds [\[87\]](#page-40-12). Similarly, Dietterich's 1995 study demonstrated how learning algorithms such as ID3 and backpropagation could improve English text-to-speech systems by enhancing text mapping to phonemes and stresses [\[88\]](#page-40-13). Additionally, Rubin's 1987 introduction of the Sampling/Importance Resampling (SIR) algorithm offered a non-iterative alternative for handling missing textual data, advantageous in settings with modest amounts of missing information [\[89\]](#page-40-14).

Challanges: Despite these advancements, traditional text augmentation methods often struggled to generate contextually relevant data, as synthesized text frequently lacked the accuracy and fluency of human-generated language [\[7,](#page-37-6) [27\]](#page-38-18). Simple techniques like synonym replacement, while initially effective, risked disrupting semantic coherence by introducing contextually inappropriate words, leading to model misunderstandings and reduced performance on downstream tasks [\[25,](#page-38-19) [90\]](#page-40-15). However, the evolution of text augmentation techniques, as illustrated in Figure [3,](#page-6-0) included diverse methods like n-gram shuffling, which added syntactic diversity, and lexical substitution using word embeddings, which enhanced lexical variety while maintaining semantic content [\[91,](#page-40-16) [92\]](#page-40-17). Advanced approaches like neural style transfer and GANs were developed to produce high-quality, contextually accurate synthetic text, addressing issues of data scarcity and class imbalance in specialized tasks such as medical report generation [\[59,](#page-39-9) [60\]](#page-39-19).

• Audio Data Augmentation: The rapid evolution of DL technologies has greatly influenced fields such as NLP, computer vision, and especially speech recognition [\[23,](#page-38-20) [93,](#page-40-18) [94\]](#page-40-19). These models' effectiveness depends significantly on the availability of large, high-quality datasets [\[95,](#page-40-20) [96\]](#page-40-21). In recent years, the advent of multi-modal LLMs has marked a significant shift in data augmentation strategies, introducing innovative techniques aimed at mitigate data scarcity that enhances the performance of models across various modalities [\[97\]](#page-40-22). This advancement is vital for increasing data volume and improving model robustness and adaptability, thereby enabling models to perform reliably under real-world conditions and preventing overfitting [\[94\]](#page-40-19). Furthermore, the role of data augmentation extends to supporting ethical AI development by fostering diversity in training datasets, which is crucial for reducing biases and promoting fairness, particularly in sensitive applications [\[95\]](#page-40-20).

Challanges: Audio data augmentation poses unique challenges, particularly in replicating authentic sound environments, which are critical for developing effective speech recognition systems [\[98,](#page-41-0) [99\]](#page-41-1). Traditional simple methods like noise addition often fall short of capturing the complexity of real acoustic environments [\[100\]](#page-41-2). Moreover, the lack of diverse and highquality training samples across various languages and dialects significantly hampers the capability of these systems [\[24\]](#page-38-21). Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of more sophisticated and rigourous data augmentation methods that can generate realistic and contextually appropriate synthetic audio data. These advanced methods are essential not only for enhancing the performance of speech recognition systems but also for ensuring they are adaptable and effective across different acoustic and linguistic contexts.

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>4 Literature Review and Comparative Analysis

In this section, we present the results of our literature review.

#### 4.1 LLM-based Image Data Augmentation

4.1.1 Process overview. Image data augmentation represents a complex, multi-step process designed to significantly enhance machine learning models by diversifying the training datasets [\[8,](#page-37-7) [101\]](#page-41-3) . Initially, the process starts with Image Encoding, where raw images are converted into a computable format, typically using a vision encoder to distill essential visual information into feature vectors. This step is crucial for preparing images for further processing, as seen in studies like those by [\[102\]](#page-41-4), where image-text contrastive learning is utilized.

Following the encoding, Prompt Generation involves the LLM generating a textual description of the encoded image. This textual prompt accurately reflects the image's content and serves as a bridge to the next augmentation steps [\[103\]](#page-41-5). Augmentation Instruction Generation then takes these descriptions to create detailed transformation instructions. For instance, DALL-E [\[103\]](#page-41-5) uses these prompts to generate synthetic images that closely mimic the textual description, enhancing datasets with varied visual representations.

The generated instructions are translated into executable code during the Natural Language to Code Translation step. This code is applied to the original images in the Code Execution phase, effectively implementing the desired augmentations. This step is exemplified in the work by [\[102\]](#page-41-4), where augmented images are created to enhance disease identification accuracy in cassava leaves. Subsequent to the transformation, the Quality Assessment phase ensures the augmented images meet high-quality standards, crucial for maintaining the natural appearance and utility of the images in training scenarios, as noted by [\[104\]](#page-41-6) in their work on breast cancer diagnosis. Metadata Generation follows, documenting the augmentation details, which is essential for reproducibility and further analytical work [\[105\]](#page-41-7).

Finally, Dataset Integration incorporates these enriched images and their metadata into larger datasets. These datasets provide a robust training environment that exposes machine learning models to a wide array of visual scenarios, significantly improving their real-world applicability. This integration process is particularly emphasized in studies like those by [\[106\]](#page-41-8), where augmented datasets help enhance diabetes management. Each of these steps, depicted in Figure [4](#page-9-0) (right side as steps), highlights the technical process of LLMs in image data augmentation for advancing AI capabilities in various domains. For example, the integration of LLMs in medical image analysis by [\[106\]](#page-41-8) and in agricultural applications by [\[102\]](#page-41-4) showcases the transformative impact of these advanced data augmentation methods, enhancing both the diversity and the quality of datasets for complex visual recognition tasks.

In the domain of medical diagnostics, LLM-based image data augmentation has shown remarkable utility, particularly in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection and treatment monitoring. For example, the Med-MLLM by Liu et al. [\[107\]](#page-41-9) leverages unlabelled data for radiograph representation learning, significantly boosting diagnostic capabilities in visual and textual analyses. Similarly, the DeepDR-LLM model introduced by Li et al. [\[106\]](#page-41-8) incorporates advanced lesion segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading techniques to improve primary diabetes care. Additionally, MISTRA by Jindal et al. [\[108\]](#page-41-10) utilizes variational autoencoders combined with multimodal fusion techniques to detect and classify medical images with high precision, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to revolutionize medical imaging and diagnostics. Table [1](#page-10-0) provides a detailed overview of multimodal LLMs in image data augmentation from th erecent published publications, illustrating the diverse applications across different domains.

Figure [4](#page-9-0) in the middle section comprehensively outlines fifteen diverse techniques of LLM-based image data augmentation identified in our survey, each leveraging the unique capabilities of LLMs to enhance, manipulate, and generate image data, as detailed below

• Image-to-text Synthesis : Recent advancements in image-to-text synthesis have harnessed the capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between visual content and textual descriptions, thereby enhancing the contextual richness of generated images. For instance, the DF-GAN model, introduced by [\[118\]](#page-41-11), simplifies the generative process through a streamlined onestage architecture, focusing on improving text-image semantic consistency. This is achieved through innovative components such as a Target-Aware Discriminator and a deep text-image fusion block, which ensure that generated images closely align with their textual descriptions, offering a marked improvement over traditional multi-stage generative adversarial networks. Similarly, [\[119\]](#page-42-0) employs rich human feedback to refine image generation in response to textual prompts. This method leverages human annotations to identify and correct areas where generated images do not accurately reflect the text, using these insights to train a multimodal transformer that adjusts the generative process, thus enhancing the fidelity and relevance of the output. Additionally, [\[120\]](#page-42-1) tackles the challenges posed by diffusion models in maintaining fidelity to complex text prompts, by introducing novel loss functions that

guide the image synthesis process more precisely, ensuring that the generated visuals are not only high in quality but also contextually appropriate.

• Semantic Content Transfer : Semantic Content Transfer is another pivotal technique in LLM-based image data augmentation, effectively infusing semantically relevant content into images to boost the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. The SemAug method, discussed by [\[121\]](#page-42-2), exemplifies this approach by dynamically incorporating contextually appropriate objects into existing images, which enhances object recognition models without the need for extensive contextual analysis. This method significantly improves model generalization capabilities as demonstrated on standard benchmarks like Pascal VOC and COCO. In a similar vein, DALDA, introduced by [\[122\]](#page-42-3), integrates semantic information through a sophisticated fusion of LLMs and Diffusion Models (DMs), utilizing enhanced text prompts and adjusted guidance weights to maintain semantic integrity while increasing dataset diversity. This method is particularly effective in scenarios with limited data, demonstrating its utility in enhancing image diversity while preserving semantic accuracy. Furthermore, [\[123\]](#page-42-4) explores the innovative use of Semantic Imagined Experience in robotics, where text-to-image diffusion models are employed to project robots into varied scenarios through augmented visual data, significantly enhancing their operational adaptability in real-world tasks.

- Image Captioning : Image Captioning for Augmentation represents a significant stride in utilizing LLMs to generate detailed, contextually aligned image captions. The FuseCap technique by [\[124\]](#page-42-5) innovatively combines machine vision insights with LLM outputs to generate enriched captions that capture overlooked details, thereby improving the training accuracy of visual-language models. This method enhances the detail and accuracy of captions, proving particularly effective in complex image-caption tasks. Additionally, [\[125\]](#page-42-6) introduces a novel approach that preserves semantic consistency between image-caption pairs through text-conditioned image modifications and advanced data augmentation techniques, such as pixel-level masking. This method ensures that the augmented pairs maintain their semantic linkage, thereby improving the efficacy of grounding-based vision and language models. The benefits of these advancements are further underscored in the study by [\[126\]](#page-42-7), where image embeddings are synthesized from captions using LLMs and image generation models, showcasing a novel pathway to enriching training datasets without relying heavily on human-labeled data.
- Conditional Image Generation : Conditional Image Generation using LLMs has significantly advanced, allowing for the generation of contextually rich and detailed images to enhance the capabilities of generative models. For example, Koh et al. [\[127\]](#page-42-8) introduced a method that combines pre-trained image encoders and decoders with text-only LLMs by mapping their embedding spaces, enabling the generation of images conditioned on complex and interleaved text and image inputs. This innovation surpasses traditional models in tasks requiring detailed language understanding. Another noteworthy contribution is from Li et al. [\[128\]](#page-42-9) with UNIMO-G, a multimodal conditional diffusion framework that excels in generating images from both textual and visual prompts. This framework distinguishes itself by using a Multimodal LLM that encodes mixed inputs and a denoising diffusion process tailored to these complex inputs, demonstrating effectiveness in generating detailed images that purely text-driven models often overlook. Furthermore, Jung et al. [\[122\]](#page-42-3) discussed DALDA, a framework that combines LLMs with diffusion models to enhance data augmentation under data-scarce conditions, ensuring the generation of semantically consistent images that remain relevant to the training needs. These studies collectively underscore the significant progress in conditional image generation, offering robust solutions for diverse and challenging scenarios.
- Contextual Object Insertion : Contextual Object Insertion in image data augmentation has seen innovative applications through LLMs, enhancing object detection and generalization capabilities of models. SemAug, introduced by Heisler et al. [\[121\]](#page-42-2), calculates and places new, contextually relevant objects into images, improving model generalization without the need for a context network and demonstrating significant mAP improvements on benchmarks like Pascal VOC and COCO. Similarly, DALDA by Jung et al. [\[122\]](#page-42-3) integrates LLMs with Diffusion Models to embed novel semantic information into text prompts, maintaining target distribution fidelity while enhancing image diversity. This method proves particularly effective in data-scarce scenarios. Moreover, Yu et al. [\[123\]](#page-42-4) explore Semantic Imagined Experience in robot learning, using text-to-image diffusion models for data augmentation to robustly perform manipulation tasks in novel scenarios
- Interactive Editing : Interactive Editing with LLMs in image augmentation represents a burgeoning field that combines user input with advanced AI techniques to refine and personalize image outputs. The Visual Editing GPT 3.5 by Sultan et al. [\[129\]](#page-42-10) utilizes a distillation approach with data augmentation to improve fine-tuning in low-data regimes by 25%, applied effectively in real-time visual editing tasks like color grading. This method demonstrates cost and latency reduction while maintaining high performance. Additionally, ForgeryGPT by Li et al. [\[130\]](#page-42-11) introduces a novel multimodal LLM for image forgery detection

and localization, integrating high-order forensics knowledge with explainable AI capabilities. This approach develops innovative training strategies and architecture enhancements, such as the Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor for precise tampering detection and localization, advancing the field towards robust, explainable image forgery analysis.

- Scene Completion : Scene completion using LLMs has become a focal area in enhancing the contextual understanding of images through the seamless integration of missing or incomplete elements. For instance, the Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) developed by Wu et al. [\[131\]](#page-42-12) uses LLMs and diffusion models to generate high-quality, diverse training images, particularly for semantic segmentation, which includes filling in missing parts of scenes to improve dataset comprehensiveness and quality. This method has shown significant improvements on standard datasets like PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014. Furthermore, the LaB-RAG system by Song et al. [\[132\]](#page-42-13) enhances radiology report generation by integrating image-derived labels with retrieval-augmented generation, effectively completing scenes with medically relevant data without the need for deep learning model retraining.
- Automated Cropping : Automated cropping leverages LLMs to intelligently crop images, focusing on enhancing the salient parts of an image while maintaining its aesthetic and informational value. This technique is particularly useful in applications where the key features within images vary widely in their placement. For instance, DIAGen introduced by Lingenberg et al. [\[133\]](#page-42-14) employs Gaussian noise and class-specific text prompts from LLMs to refine the focus of images, ensuring that the most relevant features are emphasized and less important backgrounds are minimized. Similarly, the T2Vid system by Yin et al. [\[134\]](#page-42-15) applies synthesized video-like samples to improve video understanding, which includes strategic cropping of frames to enhance the model's focus on relevant actions or objects within a dynamic scene.
- Attribute-Based Generation : Attribute-based generation using LLMs focuses on enhancing images by modifying specific attributes or incorporating new ones, thereby increasing the diversity and specificity of image datasets. This technique is crucial for applications requiring high customization or specific attribute alterations. For example, the work by DIAGen [\[133\]](#page-42-14) not only focuses on diversifying image presentations but also specifically enhances attributes based on class-specific demands, improving classification performance and handling of outof-distribution samples. Additionally, ForgeryGPT by Li et al. [\[130\]](#page-42-11) uses multimodal LLMs to detect and localize image forgeries by adjusting image attributes to match forensic profiles, enhancing the detection capabilities. These methods showcase the potential of LLMs to not only generate visually appealing images but also to tailor them to fit specific training or operational need.
- Image Enhancement : Image Enhancement through LLMs involves refining image quality and detail to improve the performance of machine learning models, especially in fields like medical imaging and autonomous driving. For instance, Med-MLLM by Liu et al. [\[107\]](#page-41-9) develops a multimodal large language model that enhances radiograph representations, aiding in more accurate disease reporting and diagnosis. Similarly, the DeepDR-LLM model by Li et al. [\[106\]](#page-41-8) integrates LLMs with deep learning for diabetes management by enhancing lesion segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading. This method significantly improves the clarity and diagnostic utility of medical images in low-resource settings. Additionally, the MISTRA framework by Jindal et al. [\[108\]](#page-41-10) employs variational autoencoders alongside CLIP and BLIP models for image enhancement, particularly improving the detection and classification of misogynous memes by refining visual cues and text-image congruence.
- Adversarial Examples Generation : Adversarial Examples Generation using LLMs serves as a robust method to test and improve the resilience of AI models against potential exploits.

This method involves creating images that are visually similar to original images but have been subtly altered to deceive AI models. For example, T2Vid by Yin et al. [\[134\]](#page-42-15) explores the generation of synthesized video-like samples that include adversarial examples to enhance video understanding and model robustness against attacks. Similarly, the DIAGen approach by Lingenberg et al. [\[133\]](#page-42-14) uses Gaussian noise and targeted attribute alterations to produce images that challenge the model's classification abilities, thereby improving its resistance to adversarial attacks.

- Multimodal Data Fusion :Multimodal Data Fusion in image data augmentation involves integrating information from various modalities, such as text, audio, and images, to create richer and more informative training datasets. This approach is exemplified by the MISTRA system by Jindal et al. [\[108\]](#page-41-10), which fuses image and text data to improve the accuracy of misogynous meme detection. Additionally, the MM-Instruct by Liu et al. [\[135\]](#page-42-16) leverages LLMs to generate diverse visual instruction data from image captioning datasets, enhancing the instructional capabilities of large multimodal models. Furthermore, Kartezio by Cortacero et al. [\[113\]](#page-41-15) introduces a Cartesian Genetic Programming-based strategy for generating interpretable image processing pipelines that effectively integrate multimodal data for biomedical image segmentation.
- Semantic Segmentation Enhancement : Semantic Segmentation Enhancement using LLMs focuses on refining the accuracy with which models delineate and categorize different regions of an image, crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. The Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) by Wu et al. [\[131\]](#page-42-12) exemplifies this by utilizing LLMs and diffusion models to generate diverse training images, particularly enhancing the model's ability to perform semantic segmentation under weak supervision. This approach notably improves segmentation accuracy on benchmark datasets like PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 by introducing high-quality, varied training examples that help models better understand complex scene compositions. Additionally, the LaB-RAG system by Song et al. [\[132\]](#page-42-13) integrates image-derived labels with retrieval-augmented generation to improve radiology report generation, indirectly enhancing semantic segmentation by providing richer context and more detailed labels for medical imaging.
- Synthetic Defect Introduction : Synthetic Defect Introduction through LLMs is a method aimed at creating images with intentionally introduced defects to train models for quality control and defect detection tasks. This method is particularly valuable in manufacturing and quality assurance where detecting subtle defects can be crucial. For instance, DIAGen by Lingenberg et al. [\[133\]](#page-42-14) uses Gaussian noise and class-specific text prompts to simulate defects in images that help models learn to identify and categorize these defects effectively. Another example is ForgeryGPT by Li et al. [\[130\]](#page-42-11), which not only detects but also localizes image forgeries by introducing synthetic tampering in a controlled manner. This method enhances the capability of models to discern and react to complex forgery patterns, which are akin to defects in digital media.
- Temporal Context Modeling : Temporal Context Modeling in image data augmentation leverages LLMs to understand and incorporate the temporal dynamics within image sequences, which is essential for tasks such as video analysis and activity recognition. The T2Vid method by Yin et al. [\[134\]](#page-42-15) enhances video understanding by using synthesized videolike samples that model temporal contexts, thus allowing models to better predict and interpret sequences of actions or events. This method reduces reliance on extensive real video datasets by providing rich, synthesized alternatives that capture essential temporal variations. Additionally, the DALL-M system by Hsieh et al. [\[136\]](#page-42-17) uses LLMs to generate synthetic clinical

data that includes temporal progressions of medical conditions, improving the predictive capabilities of models in medical diagnostics by understanding disease evolution over time.

4.1.3 Limitations and Potential Solutions. The integration of multimodal LLMs in image augmentation introduces several challenges and limitations, which are itemized below and illustrated on the rightmost side of Figure [4:](#page-9-0)

• Ambiguity and Unrealistic Outputs: LLM-based image augmentation can face issues with ambiguity and unrealistic outputs due to several underlying scientific reasons. Primarily, LLMs rely heavily on textual prompts for generating images, and if these prompts lack specificity, the resulting images may not capture essential details, leading to generalized or contextually inaccurate representations [\[118\]](#page-41-11). Additionally, the inherent limitations of LLMs in understanding complex visual semantics can further exacerbate this problem, as the models might not fully grasp subtle dynamics required for accurate visual depiction [\[119\]](#page-42-0). Consequently, this can lead to the generation of images that, while plausible at a superficial level, fail to accurately reflect detailed or scenario-specific characteristics, reducing their applicability in tasks requiring high fidelity to real-world contexts.

To address ambiguity and unrealistic outputs in LLM-based image data augmentation, future solutions could involve enhancing textual prompts with more detailed and context-specific descriptions. Implementing a multi-modal training approach, where LLMs are trained not just on text but also on richly annotated visual datasets, could improve the models' understanding of complex visual contexts [\[28,](#page-38-22) [29\]](#page-38-23). Additionally, integrating feedback loops where outputs are evaluated and corrected by humans could refine the models' generative capabilities. Advanced algorithms for semantic parsing could also be employed to better interpret and execute nuanced textual prompts, ensuring that the generated images maintain high fidelity to specified details.

• Contextual and Semantic Misalignment: Contextual and semantic misalignment presents a significant challenge in LLM-based image augmentation due to the complexity inherent in accurately interpreting and integrating contextual cues within images [\[124\]](#page-42-5). LLMs, despite their advanced capabilities, can falter in understanding the intricate relationships and subtleties that define a coherent visual context. This misalignment often results in object placements and enhancements that do not logically fit within the existing scene structure, making them appear out of context or blatantly irrelevant [\[136\]](#page-42-17). Such inaccuracies can critically undermine the realism and practical utility of the augmented images, rendering them less effective or even unusable for tasks that require high levels of contextual accuracy, such as in training datasets for AI-driven visual recognition systems. The lack of precise semantic understanding in LLMs thus poses a barrier to creating believable and contextually appropriate visual content, which is essential for applications across various domains that rely on visual data [\[137\]](#page-42-18).

Addressing the limitation of contextual and semantic misalignment in LLM-based image augmentation can be approached by enhancing the contextual awareness and semantic understanding of LLMs. One scientific method involves training LLMs on a broader and more diverse set of context-rich image-text pairs, which can help the models learn more dynamic interpretations of visual contexts and their corresponding textual descriptions [\[29,](#page-38-23) [30\]](#page-38-2). Additionally, integrating attention mechanisms can enable LLMs to focus on relevant parts of an image in relation to textual cues, improving alignment accuracy. Employing advanced techniques such as contrastive learning could also refine the models' ability to distinguish between contextually appropriate and inappropriate augmentations.

• User Dependency: User dependency poses a significant limitation in the current state of image augmentation using multimodal LLMs due to the crucial role that the quality of input prompts and training data plays in determining the effectiveness of the augmentation process. When these inputs are inconsistent or of poor quality, they can result in augmentations that vary widely in quality, thereby adversely affecting the performance and generalizability of the models [\[136\]](#page-42-17). This dependence on user-provided data means that LLM-based augmentation systems are only as good as the information they are given. Substandard or contextually inaccurate prompts may lead LLMs to generate irrelevant or misleading outputs, which not only diminish the utility of the augmented images but also hinder the training of robust AI systems capable of operating effectively in diverse real-world scenarios [\[137\]](#page-42-18).

To mitigate the limitation of user dependency in LLM-based image augmentation, it is essential to enhance the robustness and contextual understanding of LLMs. One scientific approach is to implement adaptive learning algorithms that can refine their performance over time based on feedback loops. These feedback mechanisms allow LLMs to learn from the outcomes of their augmentations and adjust future outputs accordingly, reducing reliance on initial input quality [\[28\]](#page-38-22). Additionally, employing sophisticated preprocessing techniques to standardize and enrich input data can help normalize input quality variations [\[30,](#page-38-2) [136\]](#page-42-17). Advanced natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities can be integrated to better interpret and clarify ambiguous or poorly defined prompts. Finally, augmenting training datasets with a wider range of high-quality, annotated examples can teach LLMs to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate augmentations, even from suboptimal inputs.

• Over-Specialization and Action Complexity: Over-specialization and action complexity in LLM-based image augmentation arise primarily from the substantial computational demands associated with processing large datasets or complex multimodal inputs. LLMs, by design, integrate and analyze vast amounts of data to generate high-quality augmentations. This process often involves deep neural networks and sophisticated algorithms that are computationally intensive and energy-consuming [\[137\]](#page-42-18). For applications that necessitate real-time processing, such as interactive media or live surveillance analysis, the latency introduced by these computational requirements can render LLM-based solutions impractical. Moreover, the complexity of actions, which refers to the multitude of steps and computations the LLM must perform to produce a single output, further complicates deployment in constrained or low-resource environments. This complexity not only affects scalability but also limits the potential for broader application of LLM technologies in fields where immediate response and agility are crucial [\[136,](#page-42-17) [137\]](#page-42-18).

To overcome the limitation of over-specialization and action complexity in LLM-based image augmentation, it is crucial to optimize the computational efficiency of these models. One approach involves refining model architecture to reduce complexity without compromising performance, such as using lighter neural network layers or pruning redundant parameters . Implementing more efficient algorithms for processing, like quantization or knowledge distillation, can also decrease computational load, enabling faster processing with fewer resources. Additionally, leveraging edge computing can distribute the computational tasks closer to the data source, reducing latency for real-time applications. Furthe, adopting adaptive computation techniques, which dynamically adjust the processing power based on the complexity of the task, can ensure optimal resource utilization and enhance scalability.

• Model Integrity and Alignment Issues: Model integrity and alignment issues present significant limitations in LLM-based image data augmentation due to the challenges of integrating these advanced models seamlessly with existing technological frameworks. LLMs are typically designed to generate or manipulate data based on very complex and often domainspecific training. When integrated into broader systems that were not originally designed with these models in mind, discrepancies can arise between the output expectations and the actual performance of the LLMs [\[137\]](#page-42-18). Ensuring that the augmented outputs align with the specific requirements of practical applications involves not only technical adjustments to harmonize the interface between the LLMs and existing systems but also continuous calibration to maintain the fidelity of the outputs. The complexity of these tasks often requires substantial computational resources and sophisticated algorithms to manage the dynamic nature of LLM behaviors, making integration both technically demanding and resource-intensive. This need for high-level expertise and significant computational investment to ensure alignment complicates the adoption of LLMs in diverse operational environments.

Overcoming model integrity and alignment issues in LLM-based image data augmentation can be achieved through several scientific approaches. Firstly, employing modular integration strategies can allow for more flexible adaptation of LLMs within existing frameworks. This involves designing interfaces that can dynamically adjust to the outputs of LLMs, ensuring smoother integration and alignment with application-specific requirements. Secondly, continuous training and fine-tuning of the models on domain-specific datasets can enhance their understanding and performance, thereby improving the consistency and relevance of their outputs. Thirdly, implementing rigorous validation and testing protocols that simulate real-world scenarios can help identify and correct misalignments before full deployment. Finally, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques such as transfer learning can aid in adapting pre-trained models to new tasks or environments more effectively, enhancing their generalizability and utility across various applications.

• Overfitting and Prediction Challenges: Overfitting and prediction challenges are significant limitations in LLM-based image data augmentation, largely due to the models' propensity to reinforce existing biases and learn specific patterns too well. LLMs, when trained on datasets that lack diversity or fail to capture the full complexity of the target domain, might generate augmented data that is too narrowly tailored to the specific examples they have been exposed to. This results in a model that performs well on training data but poorly generalizes to new, unseen data. Scientifically, this issue arises because LLMs, particularly those with vast parameter spaces, are highly capable of memorizing rather than generalizing from input data. The absence of diverse and comprehensive training examples restricts the model's ability to develop robust predictive capabilities, leading it to make decisions based on limited or skewed perspectives, thereby significantly undermining its effectiveness in real-world applications [\[136\]](#page-42-17).

To address overfitting and prediction challenges in LLM-based image data augmentation, several scientific strategies can be employed. Firstly, enhancing the diversity of the training dataset is crucial. Incorporating a wide range of images from various contexts and conditions can provide a broader base of examples for the LLM to learn from, promoting better generalization to new data. Secondly, implementing regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping during the training process can prevent the model from fitting too closely to the training data. Additionally, employing cross-validation methods can help in assessing how the model will perform on independent data sets. Furthermore, using ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to make predictions, can reduce variance and improve the robustness of the predictions, further mitigating overfitting issues.

Point Cloud Data Augmentation While point cloud augmentation has traditionally relied on geometric, noise-based, or generative methods in ML/DL frameworks, an emerging research direction involves leveraging LLMs for more context-driven 3D shape manipulation as presented in [5.](#page-17-0) These new approaches typically combine text-driven prompts or semantic information with 3D generation pipelines, offering a richer way to produce and edit point clouds.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>![](_page_17_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 5 conceptualizes LLM-based 3D augmentation, illustrating how text prompts can specify modifications to base objects, such as scaling, thereby enhancing the flexibility and creativity in 3D shape manipulation, which is crucial for applications in robotics and virtual environments.

Fig. 5. Conceptual example of LLM-based 3D augmentation. Given a base object, a text prompt could specify modifications like scaling. Adopted from [\[138\]](#page-42-19)

- Moving Beyond Traditional and ML/DL Methods: Traditional data augmentation strategies focus on generic geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling, translation, and flipping [\[139,](#page-42-20) [140\]](#page-42-21), random dropout or noise injection [\[141\]](#page-42-22), and region-level editing [\[142,](#page-42-23) [143\]](#page-43-0). More advanced deep learning methods use generative models like 3D-GANs [\[144\]](#page-43-1), VAEs [\[145\]](#page-43-2), or diffusion models [\[146,](#page-43-3) [147\]](#page-43-4) to produce synthetic shapes. These approaches have proven effective, but typically require handcrafted rules or high-level neural networks that do not incorporate natural language feedback. Consequently, the range of possible edits remains constrained by predefined transformations or learned latent spaces.
- Text-Guided Shape Editing and Augmentation: One of the most direct ways LLMs contribute to point cloud augmentation is via text-guided shape editing, where a user or system provides natural language instructions that drive the modifications. Kim et al. [\[148\]](#page-43-5) introduced a text-to-mesh stylization framework that uses CLIP - an early precursor to multimodal LLMs to align a given 3D surface with text prompts (for example, "make it look like coral"). Although focused on meshes, similar text-driven approaches for point clouds have begun to appear. These systems typically rely on LLM-based encoders to parse text instructions and then invoke a generative or editing module to reshape the geometry accordingly, effectively bridging language and 3D shape manipulation.
- Point-E and Shap-E: Diffusion Models with LLM Guidance: OpenAI's Point-E [\[149\]](#page-43-6) and Shap-E [\[150\]](#page-43-7) highlight a diffusion-like pipeline for generating 3D point clouds or meshes from textual descriptions. These models often use large text encoders (e.g., from GPT or CLIP families) to interpret prompts such as "a chair with curved legs and a tall backrest," then sample a 3D object consistent with that description. While these systems primarily aim to synthesize 3D shapes from scratch, they also open the door to augmenting existing datasets by generating infinite shape variations with natural language refinements. In principle, one could prompt, "Generate 50 more chairs that have slightly thicker legs and smaller backrests," thereby expanding the range of training samples for a 3D classifier or detector.
- DreamFusion and Zero-1-to-3: Text-Conditioned Neural Fields: A parallel branch of work employs NeRF-like or implicit field representations for text-guided 3D reconstruction. DreamFusion [\[151\]](#page-43-8) and Zero-1-to-3 [\[152\]](#page-43-9) both incorporate LLM-based text encoders (often CLIP or a derivative multimodal module) and an optimization process that iteratively refines a neural field to match the text prompt. Although many of these methods yield volumetric

or implicit representations, the resulting geometry can be sampled to produce point clouds. For data augmentation, researchers can systematically vary prompts (e.g., "a slightly longer couch," "a couch with no legs," "a couch with accent pillows") to create a diverse set of shapes without manual 3D modeling.

- Semantic Part Replacement Driven by LLMs: Earlier methods for part swapping in point clouds relied on manual labels or specialized networks that recognized object parts (leg, seat, handle, etc.) [\[153,](#page-43-10) [154\]](#page-43-11). LLMs now offer a more semantic approach, where the model can parse descriptions ("replace the top of this mug with a small dome") and translate them into structured part edits [\[155\]](#page-43-12). The system might first map "top of a mug" to a region of a known shape, then retrieve the requested "small dome" geometry from another shape library, assembling them with appropriate scaling. This process can significantly enrich the object varieties seen during training.
- Context-Aware Augmentation for 3D Scenes: Autonomous vehicles and robotics often work in 3D worlds with multiple objects and complex layouts. LLM-driven augmentation can add or modify objects in scene point clouds according to textual commands specifying the scenario. For instance, a user might say, "Add a parked car next to the curb," and the system, guided by an LLM, would select a car model, position it near the curb, and align it with the coordinate system [\[156\]](#page-43-13). This approach yields more realistic, scenario-specific data, which helps domain adaptation and robustness. By leveraging an LLM's language-based reasoning, one can generate many scene variations with minimal manual labeling.
- Potential Challenges and Limitations : Although LLM-based approaches promise unprecedented flexibility, they also face unique hurdles. Generating fully realistic and collision-free object placements can be challenging if the LLM's world model is incomplete or if the generative modules are poorly trained. Text prompts can be ambiguous, leading to geometry that misaligns with the intended meaning, particularly if the system lacks strong 3D priors. Another issue involves the computational overhead of large-scale text-driven generation, as well as possible biases in the textual data used to train LLMs. If the model has not been exposed to certain geometric or stylistic concepts, it may struggle to produce them accurately.

In the next few years, researchers are likely to develop more refined pipelines where a language model, a shape retrieval system, and a 3D generative model interact seamlessly. This could involve iterative "conversation-like" steps (e.g., "Make the table thinner," "Shorten the legs," "Move it closer to the wall") akin to prompt engineering, ensuring each new shape version remains semantically valid. There is also a growing push toward multimodal pretraining that unifies 2D images, textual captions, and 3D geometry [\[157\]](#page-43-14), enabling richer cross-domain data augmentation. Over time, these tools could democratize 3D dataset creation, allowing even non-experts to tailor large point cloud datasets for any target application.

#### 4.2 LLM-based Text Data Augmentation

4.2.1 Process Overview. The process of text data augmmentation using multimodal LLMs can be summarized into eight key steps as illustrated in Figure [6\(](#page-19-0)left side). It begins with text encoding, where raw text data is transformed into a machine-readable format through techniques like tokenization and embedding. Tokenization breaks down the text into manageable units, while embedding assigns these units into a high-dimensional space that reflects semantic relationships [\[158\]](#page-43-15). This encoded form serves as the foundation for the LLM to understand and interact with the text. Following encoding, prompt generation occurs where the LLM utilizes the encoded data to generate prompts that direct the augmentation. These prompts define the type of transformations needed, such as paraphrasing or stylistic changes, which guide the subsequent augmentation steps. Next, augmentation instruction generation takes the prompts to develop specific directives for altering the text [\[159\]](#page-43-16). These instructions dictate exact changes like synonym replacement or sentence rephrasing, ensuring the modifications align with the augmentation goals. The process then moves into natural language to task-specific transformations, where these instructions are interpreted and applied to the text, adapting it for specific tasks while maintaining linguistic accuracy [\[158\]](#page-43-15). This stage is crucial for ensuring the relevance and applicability of the transformations to the intended training objectives.

Following this, text transformation execution is carried out, where the actual modifications are implemented on the text. This involves sophisticated linguistic manipulation techniques that adjust the text according to the predefined instructions, ensuring the new versions are both varied and contextually appropriate [\[160\]](#page-43-17). The sixth step, quality assessment, evaluates the augmented texts against quality standards such as grammaticality, coherence, and task relevance. This evaluation often employs both automated metrics and manual reviews to ensure only high-quality augmentations are retained [\[161\]](#page-43-18). Upon successful quality verification, dataset integration occurs, where the augmented texts are systematically compiled into the training dataset. Alongside, metadata generation provides a comprehensive annotation of the modifications applied, including the type and scope of transformations. This metadata is essential for tracking the augmentation impacts and refining future augmentation strategies, thereby enhancing the training datasets' utility and effectiveness in developing robust NLP models[\[158,](#page-43-15) [161\]](#page-43-18).

4.2.2 Methods and Techniques. Figure [6](#page-19-0) in the middle section comprehensively outlines fifteen diverse techniques of LLM-based text data augmentation identified in our survey as detailed below:

<span id="page-19-0"></span>![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 6 depicts the technical process of LLM-based text data augmentation, detailing methods such as paraphrasing, back-translation, and synonym replacement, while also addressing limitations like context loss and semantic drift, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation metrics to ensure the quality of augmented text.

• Paraphrasing: Paraphrasing is a critical technique in text data augmentation where the semantics of the original text are preserved while the phrasing and structure are altered. This is achieved through sophisticated LLMs, which analyze and reconstruct text to enhance the richness and diversity of datasets. The method is particularly beneficial in applications requiring nuanced expression alterations without changing underlying meanings, such as personality detection [\[158\]](#page-43-15) and text classification [\[160\]](#page-43-17). For instance, by leveraging semantic and linguistic enrichments, LLMs effectively tailor text data to fit various contexts and styles, thereby improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning models. This approach not only aids in the training of NLP systems but also addresses the challenge of dataset scarcity and bias [\[132\]](#page-42-13), [\[177\]](#page-44-0).

#### Table 2. Survey of Multi-modal LLMs in Text Data Augmentation (Peer Reviewed Papers)

• Back-Translation:Back translation involves translating text to a different language and then translating it back to the original language, serving as a powerful method for text augmentation. This technique enriches the linguistic diversity and syntactic variety of text data, crucial for training more resilient NLP models. Studies like [\[178\]](#page-44-11) utilize back translation to enhance the accuracy of audio description translations in multilingual settings, ensuring the translations retain their original semantic richness across different languages. Moreover, this method supports the improvement of text classification systems by expanding the training dataset with varied syntactical structures, which helps in reducing model overfitting on specific language patterns [\[179\]](#page-44-12), [\[180\]](#page-44-13).

- Text Expansion: Text expansion involves elaborating or extending existing text data to create new content that maintains the original context but adds additional descriptive detail. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where detailed explanatory content enhances model training, such as in medical report generation [\[132\]](#page-42-13) or environmental informatics [\[177\]](#page-44-0). By using LLMs to systematically expand text data, researchers can generate more comprehensive training examples that simulate a wider range of real-world applications. This method not only improves the depth and detail of the datasets but also aids models in developing a better understanding of nuanced contexts and complex scenarios [\[181\]](#page-44-14), [\[182\]](#page-44-15). Additionally, text expansion has proven effective in increasing the robustness of models against overfitting by providing them with a broader array of expressions and contexts, thereby enhancing the generalization capabilities of NLP systems.
- Role Playing:Role playing in text data augmentation involves simulating different perspectives or personas using LLMs to generate diverse responses based on specified roles. This method effectively broadens the scope of conversational models and enhances their ability to handle varied interaction styles, crucial for applications like customer service bots or interactive AI agents. By adopting multiple character roles, LLMs such as those discussed in [\[132\]](#page-42-13) and [\[177\]](#page-44-0) can produce more natural and contextually appropriate dialogues, significantly improving user engagement and satisfaction. Role playing also aids in training AI to understand and replicate human emotional nuances, thereby making interactions more realistic and empathetic [\[182\]](#page-44-15), [\[161\]](#page-43-18).
- Synonym Replacement:Synonym replacement is a straightforward yet effective text augmentation technique where words or phrases within a text are replaced with their synonyms to introduce lexical diversity without altering the original meaning. This method is instrumental in training NLP models to recognize and process a broader range of lexical variations, enhancing their linguistic adaptability and understanding. Synonym replacement is particularly valuable in tasks like sentiment analysis and text classification, where the robustness of the model against different expressions of the same sentiment or topic is crucial [\[158\]](#page-43-15), [\[160\]](#page-43-17). By integrating synonym replacement, studies such as [\[183\]](#page-44-16) and [\[180\]](#page-44-13) demonstrate improved model performance across various text-based tasks by effectively expanding the dataset's lexical field without compromising data quality or contextual relevance.
- Text Simplification :Text simplification involves reducing the linguistic complexity of text while maintaining its essential information and meaning, making it accessible to broader audiences, including those with limited language skills or cognitive impairments. This augmentation technique is crucial in educational technologies and readability enhancements, where complex information needs to be conveyed in simpler terms. Simplification can help in training models to generate more user-friendly content, which is especially important in medical or legal information dissemination [\[132\]](#page-42-13), [\[178\]](#page-44-11). Moreover, by simplifying text, LLMs such as those utilized in [\[181\]](#page-44-14) and [\[177\]](#page-44-0) can produce data that supports models in achieving better accuracy in understanding and processing simplified narratives, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of AI systems in real-world applications.
- Textual Entailment Generation : Textual entailment generation involves using LLMs to create pairs of texts where one text (the premise) logically implies the other (the hypothesis). This form of augmentation is crucial for training models in natural language understanding tasks, such as question answering and information retrieval, where understanding the relationship between text segments can dramatically improve performance. Recent studies like those by [\[181\]](#page-44-14) and [\[180\]](#page-44-13) have utilized LLMs to automatically generate large datasets of entailment pairs, which help in improving the inference capabilities of NLP models under various contexts. [\[132\]](#page-42-13) and [\[182\]](#page-44-15) also highlighted the use of entailment generation to refine

models' ability to process and understand nuanced human language, thus enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.

- Noise Injection : Noise injection in text data augmentation involves intentionally adding errors or variations to text data, such as misspellings, grammatical errors, or shuffled word orders, to simulate real-world inaccuracies that models may encounter. This technique is crucial for building robust NLP systems that can effectively handle imperfect inputs. Studies by [\[171\]](#page-44-5) and [\[173\]](#page-44-7) have shown that training models with noised data can significantly improve their performance in tasks like speech recognition and optical character recognition where input data often contains errors. [\[164\]](#page-43-21) and [\[167\]](#page-44-1) further demonstrate that noise injection helps in enhancing the model's resilience against overfitting and improving its ability to generalize from training to real-world application scenarios. By exposing models to a wider array of linguistic variations, noise injection ensures that NLP systems are not only accurate but also adaptable to the imperfect nature of human-generated text.
- Contextual Variation : Contextual variation in text augmentation leverages LLMs to modify a given text's context or to extend its narrative, thus enriching the dataset with diverse linguistic structures and themes. This method is particularly effective in enhancing the model's ability to understand and generate text that varies significantly in style, tone, or context. By integrating studies like [\[161\]](#page-43-18) and [\[169\]](#page-44-3), researchers can produce text variations that mimic different dialects, cultural nuances, or domain-specific jargon, broadening the training data's scope and depth. Additionally, works by [\[158\]](#page-43-15) and [\[160\]](#page-43-17) have utilized contextual variations to improve the performance of models in tasks that require a deep understanding of contextspecific language use, such as sentiment analysis and personalized content generation. This approach not only improves the linguistic versatility of the models but also their applicability across various domains and user groups.
- Controlled Generation : Controlled generation using LLMs focuses on generating text based on specific guidelines or constraints, such as maintaining a certain tone, style, or adhering to predefined content themes. This form of text data augmentation is essential for applications requiring high levels of precision and customization, like marketing content creation or legal document preparation. Controlled generation techniques have been explored in studies like [\[178\]](#page-44-11) and [\[177\]](#page-44-0), where LLMs are used to ensure that the generated text meets the specific needs of multilingual translation or tailored content creation. Further, [\[132\]](#page-42-13) and [\[184\]](#page-44-17) demonstrate how controlled generation can be applied to create highly targeted training data that enhances the performance of NLP systems within specific functional parameters. This method not only ensures the relevance and applicability of the generated text but also enhances the effectiveness of the training process by aligning it closely with the end-use cases.

#### 4.2.3 Limitations and Potential Solutions.

• Loss of context: Zhao et al. (2024) observed context loss in their study on improving text classification with LLM-based data augmentation [\[160\]](#page-43-17). They found that when generating entirely new samples using ChatGPT, the model sometimes produced text that lacked the necessary context for accurate classification. This was particularly evident in domain-specific datasets, where the generated samples failed to capture the detai context of the original data. The loss of context in LLM-based text augmentation can be mitigated through the implementation of fine-tuning strategies that incorporate a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts, as demonstrated by Yoran et al. (2024) who achieved robustness to irrelevant information with as few as 1,000 training examples [\[185\]](#page-44-18).

To improve the loss of context in LLM-based text augmentation, it is essential to adopt strategies that enhance the model's ability to retain and understand relevant contexts. One effective approach is through fine-tuning the LLMs on domain-specific datasets. This method enables the models to learn the intricacies and typical patterns within specialized contexts, thereby generating text that maintains the depth and relevance of the original data. Additionally, implementing mixed-context training, can further strengthen the model's robustness against irrelevant information [\[186\]](#page-44-19). By incorporating a controlled mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts into the training set, LLMs can learn to discern and prioritize information that is crucial for accurate text generation and classification.

• Semantic Drift Risk The issue of semantic drift was noted by Whitehouse et al. (2023) in their work on LLM-powered data augmentation for multilingual commonsense reasoning [\[187\]](#page-44-20). They observed that when generating Tamil text using GPT-4, the model often inserted "uncommon and out-of-context words." For example, the generated text would include phrases that were semantically incorrect or inappropriate for the given context, demonstrating a drift from the intended meaning. Semantic drift can be addressed by employing filtering methods, such as using natural language inference models to assess the relevance of generated content to the original task or domain [\[185,](#page-44-18) [188\]](#page-44-21).

To minimize the risk of semantic drift in LLM-based text data augmentation for deep learning applications, it is essential to employ advanced filtering and training strategies. Integrating natural language inference (NLI) models can be highly effective. These models assess the logical and contextual relevance of the generated text, ensuring it aligns with the original input's semantic boundaries. This acts as a critical check against the insertion of out-ofcontext or inappropriate content. Expanding and diversifying the training datasets is another crucial strategy. By incorporating a wide range of linguistic dynamics and diverse contexts, especially in multilingual settings, the LLM can develop a more robust understanding of language patterns. This extensive exposure helps the model better grasp and reproduce the contextual subtleties required for accurate text augmentation. Additionally, implementing adaptive training methods that include feedback loops to continuously refine the model's outputs can further enhance accuracy. This approach allows for real-time adjustments to the model's parameters, correcting deviations and aligning generated content more closely with desired semantic and contextual standards.

• Redundancies and Authenticity Concern: in LLM-generated text were also identified by Whitehouse et al. (2023) [\[187\]](#page-44-20). They found that the augmented data often contained "redundant words with the same meaning." An example they provided was the phrase "I will retry to try it again," where the concepts of retrying and trying again are unnecessarily repeated, creating redundancy in the generated text. Redundancies in augmented text can be reduced through the application of model compression techniques like pruning and quantization, which optimize the model's efficiency without significant performance loss, thereby improving the quality and conciseness of generated content [\[189,](#page-45-0) [190\]](#page-45-1). LLM-based text augmentation, while powerful, faces significant authenticity concerns as a key limitation. Research by Silva et al. (2024) [\[175\]](#page-44-9) and Wu et al. (2023) [\[191\]](#page-45-2) highlights this issue. Silva's team found that LLMs can produce convincingly human-like texts, creating challenges in authorship attribution, especially in literary contexts. They observed LLMs could generate novels falsely attributed to famous authors or mimic the style of well-known works. Wu's study revealed LLMs' tendency to fabricate information, rely on outdated data, and be overly sensitive to prompts, potentially spreading misinformation and undermining expertise. Both studies emphasize the difficulty in distinguishing LLM-generated content from humanauthored text, with human detection methods proving unreliable

Future research in LLM-based text augmentation could focus on developing advanced filtering mechanisms that leverage natural language inference models and semantic similarity metrics to ensure generated content maintains contextual relevance, semantic coherence, and authenticity, while simultaneously implementing robust verification systems that employ multi-modal analysis to detect and mitigate potential fabrications or misattributions in augmented text

- Oversimplification Risk: Oversimplification Risk in LLM-based text augmentation refers to the potential for generated data to lack the complexity and nuance of real-world examples, potentially leading to reduced model performance on more intricate tasks. This limitation was identified in a study published in August 2024 titled "LLMs vs Established Text Augmentation Techniques for Classification [\[183\]](#page-44-16). The researchers found that while LLM-based augmentation can improve downstream classifier accuracy, it may not always outperform established methods significantly. They observed that LLM-generated samples might oversimplify the original text, especially when dealing with complex topics or specialized domains. This oversimplification can result in a loss of important contextual information or subtle features that are crucial for certain classification tasks. The study emphasized the need for careful consideration when using LLM-based augmentation, particularly in domains where detailed understanding is critical for accurate classification. Additionally, the risk of LLMs providing overly simplistic or reductionist assessments, especially in the context of economic policy is highlighted in a recent study [\[192\]](#page-45-3). The authors warned that LLMs might generate advice that overlooks important contextual factors, unintended consequences, or distributional effects, potentially leading to suboptimal or harmful decisions if relied upon too heavily.
- Precision Loss and Logical Inconsistency: LLMs often struggle to maintain the semantic integrity of the original text during augmentation. This can result in data that, while varied, might not always be semantically consistent with the source or contextually appropriate, affecting the quality and usability of the augmented data in training models for specific task[\[193\]](#page-45-4).The effectiveness of data augmentation heavily relies on the quality of the augmentation instructions provided to the LLM. Poorly defined or ambiguous instructions can lead to augmented data that does not meet the desired criteria or varies significantly in quality across different tasks. A study on ChatGPT-based data augmentation for text classification found that for labels with already sufficient training samples and high accuracy, adding augmented data may introduce noise and decrease performance [\[160,](#page-43-17) [194\]](#page-45-5). Likewise, logical inconsistency in LLM-based text data augmentation poses a significant limitation, impacting the utility and reliability of augmented datasets. Despite LLMs' remarkable capabilities in generating diverse and voluminous textual content, their tendency to produce logically inconsistent outputs when faced with complex input queries can severely undermine the quality of augmented text [\[195\]](#page-45-6). This inconsistency often manifests as a divergence in the logical coherence of the text relative to the original material, which is especially detrimental in tasks requiring precise logical structures, such as legal reasoning, academic research, and technical documentation[\[195,](#page-45-6) [196\]](#page-45-7). When employing LLMs for text augmentation, especially in sophisticated domains that require high fidelity to original content meaning and structure, the challenge lies in ensuring that augmented outputs maintain the same logical and factual integrity as their sources [\[197\]](#page-45-8). The issue is exacerbated by LLMs' susceptibility to generating responses that, while superficially plausible, may harbor subtle logical errors or misrepresentations known as "hallucinations" in AI parlance . Such errors can mislead downstream applications, lead to the propagation of inaccuracies, and reduce the overall effectiveness of models trained on these datasets.

To overcome precision loss and logical inconsistency in LLM-based text augmentation, it is essential to refine the quality control mechanisms and provide precise, context-specific augmentation guidelines. Enhancing training data with well-annotated, high-quality examples that demonstrate desired outcomes can help LLMs learn to generate more accurate and logically consistent augmentations. Implementing post-generation validation steps, such as semantic and logical coherence checks using rule-based systems or secondary models trained to identify and correct inconsistencies, can further mitigate errors. Additionally, fine-tuning LLMs on a domain-specific corpus before deployment can align their outputs more closely with the contextual and factual demands of specific tasks [\[160,](#page-43-17) [195\]](#page-45-6).

• Excessive Noise: Excessive noise in text data augmentation using LLMs refers to the introduction of too much irrelevant or incorrect information during the augmentation process, potentially degrading the quality of the generated data. This can lead to reduced model performance and increased overfitting [\[193\]](#page-45-4). Recent studies have highlighted this limitation. Ye et al. (2024) demonstrated that excessive noise in LLM-generated augmented data can compromise the semantic integrity of the original text, leading to decreased name entity recognition (NER) model performance [\[193\]](#page-45-4) . Similarly, Bolding et al. (2023) [\[198\]](#page-45-9)observed that while LLMs can effectively clean noisy translation data, they may introduce excessive noise when generating entirely new samples, necessitating careful balance in data augmentation strategies.

To address excessive noise in text augmentation using LLMs, researchers have proposed implementing noise control mechanisms and leveraging LLMs' capabilities for targeted data cleaning [\[199\]](#page-45-10). Such approaches include using LLMs to select appropriate noise types for finetuning, employing curriculum learning to gradually increase data complexity, and utilizing LLMs to remove specific types of noise while preserving semantic integrity [\[198,](#page-45-9) [199\]](#page-45-10).

• Limited Diversity: Limited diversity in LLM-based text data augmentation refers to the challenge of generating sufficiently varied and unique text samples while maintaining semantic consistency with the original data [\[19\]](#page-37-16). This can lead to reduced model generalization and reinforcement of existing biases, as the augmented datasets lack the breadth of linguistic expressions, structures, or content necessary to improve model performance effectively [\[200\]](#page-45-11). Recent studies have extensively explored this limitation and proposed various strategies to address it, emphasizing the critical need to enhance diversity in LLM-generated text for data augmentation [\[201\]](#page-45-12).

To address this, recent research has focused on developing strategies to increase the diversity in LLM-generated text. For instance, Cigen et al. (2024) [\[202\]](#page-45-13) explored how diversity incentives, such as the use of taboo words, chaining techniques, and hints, can enhance lexical diversity in generated paraphrases, ultimately improving downstream model performance. Likewise, future strategies should include diversifying the initial training data, implementing controlled augmentation techniques, and utilizing hybrid models that blend LLMs with adaptive learning methods. Fine-tuning on specialized datasets and applying regularization techniques can help generate more context-specific and varied outputs. Development of diversity-specific evaluation metrics and post-generation refinement processes are also vital. Additionally, monitoring and mitigating biases is crucial to ensure that the augmented data is not only linguistically diverse but also inclusively represents different perspectives, thereby enhancing model robustness and applicability across various domains.

### 4.3 LLM-Based Speech Data Augmentation

4.3.1 Process Overview. Multimodal LLM-based speech data augmentation can be explained in 7 steps as depicted in Figure [7](#page-27-0) (left side). The initial phase of LLM-based speech data augmentation starts with the meticulous preprocessing of raw audio data. This process involves sampling the audio at a consistent rate, normalizing volume levels to a standard decibel range, and segmenting the speech into shorter clips to facilitate processing efficiency. These steps are critical for ensuring uniformity in data quality, which is vital for effective feature extraction. The feature extraction step converts this standardized audio into a set of features more amenable to machine learning algorithms. Techniques such as extracting Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and generating spectrograms are common, as they distill the essential characteristics of speech necessary for recognizing phonetic elements. This extraction process is foundational for enhancing model training and accuracy in diverse acoustic conditions, as demonstrated by Cai et al. ([\[203\]](#page-45-14)) and reinforced by Dhingra et al. ([\[204\]](#page-45-15)) in their work on audio-visual deepfake detection and speech de-identification.

The third step involves applying a variety of traditional audio augmentation techniques such as noise injection, time stretching, pitch shifting, and volume adjustment. These manipulations introduce critical variability into the audio data, mimicking real-world audio environments and thus enhancing the robustness of the subsequent models. This approach is crucial for training models to perform reliably across different speaking conditions and noise levels. Studies by Dhingra et al. ([\[205\]](#page-45-16)) and Ma et al. ([\[206\]](#page-45-17)) provide evidence that such diversity in training data significantly improves the resilience and accuracy of speech recognition and emotion recognition systems, respectively. The next step is embedding with Multimodal Context and Synthetic Speech Generation, where embeddings are generated using multimodal Large Language Models that integrate both textual and acoustic information, creating a nuanced understanding of the speech context. These embeddings are pivotal for generating synthetic speech through advanced neural network architectures like variational autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This process synthesizes new speech samples that retain the linguistic properties of the original data while varying in vocal intonations and environmental sounds, thereby enriching the training dataset with realistic, diverse samples. The integration of LLMs in this process, as explored by Xu ([\[207\]](#page-45-18)) and Wu et al. ([\[159\]](#page-43-16)), enables the generation of high-quality synthetic speech that significantly enhances training data diversity and model performance.

The final step is refinement, filteringa nd integration into DL training set which involve the refinement and filtering of the generated synthetic speech to ensure it meets quality standards without unwanted noise or artifacts. This step is critical to maintaining the usability of the synthetic samples in training robust speech recognition systems. Once refined, these samples are integrated into the main training dataset, where they contribute to a comprehensive and varied training environment. This enriched dataset is then used to train and continually refine deep learning models, ensuring they are well-adapted to a variety of speech patterns and acoustic environments. The effectiveness of this comprehensive training approach is supported by the work of Xu ([\[207\]](#page-45-18)) and Ghosh et al. ([\[208\]](#page-45-19)), who have demonstrated how diversified training sets can significantly enhance the generalizability and accuracy of speech recognition systems.

Table [3](#page-28-0) shows the detailed survey of audio data augmentation performed using multimodal LLMs in the last 5 (2020 till) years:

#### 4.3.2 Methods and Techniques.

• Background Noise Addition : Background noise addition is a prevalent method in speech data augmentation aimed at enhancing the robustness of speech recognition systems under varied acoustic environments. By introducing different types of ambient noises, such as traffic, crowd, or white noise, during the training phase, models learn to maintain accuracy despite auditory distractions. This method has been pivotal in scenarios where speech recognition must perform reliably in non-ideal and noisy conditions. For instance, the works by [\[207\]](#page-45-18)

<span id="page-27-0"></span>![](_page_27_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 7 outlines the technical aspects of LLM-based speech data augmentation, detailing the multi-step process from preprocessing audio data to generating synthetic speech, highlighting techniques such as background noise addition and pitch shifting, while also addressing challenges like temporal distortion and signal degradation.

Fig. 7. LLM based speech data augmentation : showing the technical aspect of how audio/speech augmentation using LLM is performed, the techniques of augmenting speech data using LLM and their limitations

and [\[159\]](#page-43-16) demonstrate how integrating complex audio backgrounds can prepare systems for real-world applications, significantly enhancing the environmental adaptability of speech recognition models. Additionally, [\[205\]](#page-45-16) illustrates the effectiveness of this approach in the context of speech de-identification, where noise can mask personally identifiable information, enhancing privacy. [\[203\]](#page-45-14) also utilizes background noise to challenge the robustness of audiovisual deepfake detection models, ensuring they can perform under diverse conditions.

- Amplititude Scaling : Amplitude scaling involves adjusting the volume levels of speech recordings to simulate various speaking and listening conditions. This technique is essential for training models to recognize speech across a spectrum of vocal intensities and distances from the sound source, from whispers to shouts. Amplitude scaling helps in normalizing the loudness of audio inputs, which is crucial for consistent model performance. [\[206\]](#page-45-17) applies this method to enhance the emotion recognition capabilities of systems by training them to detect subtle variations in speech dynamics that may indicate emotional states. Similarly, [\[159\]](#page-43-16) and [\[207\]](#page-45-18) have demonstrated how varying amplitude can prepare models for real-life scenarios where audio levels are not constant. [\[208\]](#page-45-19) uses amplitude scaling to test the resilience of audio classification systems, ensuring they remain effective regardless of volume variations.
- Time Stretching: Time stretching modifies the speed of speech playback without altering the pitch, effectively simulating different speech rates. This augmentation is crucial for developing ASR systems that can accurately transcribe inputs from speakers who articulate at varying speeds. By expanding or compressing the temporal duration of audio samples, models are trained to handle slow and fast speech effectively. Studies such as those by [\[206\]](#page-45-17) and [\[204\]](#page-45-15) have utilized time stretching to adapt models for emotional and secure speech recognition tasks, where delivery speed can vary significantly based on the speaker's emotional state or privacy concerns. Furthermore, [\[207\]](#page-45-18) and [\[203\]](#page-45-14) incorporate time stretching to enhance the adaptability of models in multimedia environments where speech tempo can change contextually.
- Pitch Shifting : Pitch shifting adjusts the pitch or tone of the speech while keeping the speed constant. This method is instrumental in training models to recognize voices across different age groups, genders, and vocal characteristics. By simulating a wide range of vocal pitches, speech recognition systems can better identify and understand speakers from diverse demographic backgrounds. [\[159\]](#page-43-16) and [\[207\]](#page-45-18) employ pitch shifting to diversify the acoustic properties of training datasets, improving the system's ability to generalize across different

speakers. [\[208\]](#page-45-19) and [\[206\]](#page-45-17) also highlight the use of pitch variation to train more resilient and inclusive speech recognition and emotion detection models, ensuring effectiveness across varied vocal registers.

• Text Error Correction : Text error correction in the context of speech data augmentation often involves using LLMs to identify and correct transcription errors that arise from

speech-to-text processes. This technique enhances the accuracy of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems by refining the textual output using contextual understanding and language models. The LLMs, such as those mentioned in [\[204\]](#page-45-15) and [\[208\]](#page-45-19), are trained on vast datasets, allowing them to predict and replace erroneous words or phrases accurately. Furthermore, the integration of these models in systems like the one described by [\[207\]](#page-45-18) helps in adjusting text outputs to better match the spoken input, significantly reducing the error rates in transcription. [\[219\]](#page-46-6) also highlights the application of LLMs in enhancing comprehension and response accuracy by correcting semantic errors, thus improving the overall reliability of speech-driven applications.

- Querying Transformer (Q-former) : The Querying Transformer, or Q-former, is an advanced model architecture that incorporates querying mechanisms into transformers for better handling and understanding of speech queries. This method is particularly useful in speech recognition systems where the context and intent behind spoken words are critical for accurate interpretation. By embedding querying capabilities, such as those discussed in [\[206\]](#page-45-17) and [\[187\]](#page-44-20), Q-formers can dynamically adjust their processing strategies based on the query's complexity and specificity. This adaptability is crucial in applications like customer service bots and interactive AI, where [\[213\]](#page-46-0) and [\[220\]](#page-46-7) have demonstrated significant improvements in user interaction and satisfaction by employing Q-formers to accurately address user inquiries.
- Audio Mixture Generation : Audio Mixture Generation involves creating composite audio tracks from multiple sources, which is pivotal in training robust ASR systems to handle overlapping speech and background noise. This technique uses LLMs to intelligently blend different audio signals, maintaining a balance that mimics real-world scenarios. Studies such as [\[207\]](#page-45-18) and [\[208\]](#page-45-19) utilize this method to generate training data that helps models learn to isolate relevant speech from noise. Additionally, [\[221\]](#page-46-8) and [\[222\]](#page-46-9) explore the effectiveness of audio mixture generation in enhancing the diversity and complexity of audio datasets, thus preparing ASR systems for more challenging acoustic environments.
- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) : LoRA is a technique used to fine-tune large LLMs efficiently by modifying only a small subset of model parameters, thus reducing computational costs while maintaining performance. In speech augmentation, LoRA can be applied to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific audio tasks without extensive retraining. For instance, [\[206\]](#page-45-17) and [\[204\]](#page-45-15) apply LoRA to adjust models for emotional recognition and PII masking, respectively, by focusing on layers directly involved in these tasks. This method ensures that the LLMs remain lightweight and agile, as supported by [\[187\]](#page-44-20) and [\[223\]](#page-46-10), which highlight the practicality of LoRA in deploying advanced speech technologies in resource-constrained environments.
- Audio-Text Pair Creation : Audio-Text Pair Creation is central to training multimodal LLMs, where synchronization between spoken audio and corresponding textual data is crucial. This process involves generating or curating matched pairs of text and audio to train models in tasks like audio captioning and speech recognition. The effectiveness of this method is evident in works like [\[207\]](#page-45-18) and [\[220\]](#page-46-7), where aligned audio-text pairs improve the model's ability to learn contextual nuances. Additionally, [\[208\]](#page-45-19) and [\[212\]](#page-45-23) utilize this technique to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated captions, providing a richer training dataset that mimics real-world interactions.
- Consistent Ensemble Distillation (CED) : CED) is a method that leverages the strengths of multiple models to create a single, more robust model. In the context of speech data augmentation, CED can be used to combine the outputs of various LLMs to enhance speech recognition accuracy under diverse conditions. This approach, as discussed in [\[206\]](#page-45-17) and [\[204\]](#page-45-15), involves distilling knowledge from multiple specialized models into a unified system that

exhibits improved performance and resilience. [\[213\]](#page-46-0) and [\[220\]](#page-46-7) further illustrate how CED facilitates the integration of diverse linguistic and acoustic features, enhancing the system's ability to handle complex speech patterns and ambient sounds effectively.

#### 4.3.3 Limitations and Potential Solutions.

- Temporal Distortion:Temporal distortion is a significant limitation in LLM-based audio data augmentation due to the constraints of large language models (LLMs) in handling the temporal dynamics of speech [\[224,](#page-46-11) [225\]](#page-46-12). LLMs, primarily developed for processing text, lack the specialized architecture required to effectively manage time-dependent elements in audio signals [\[206\]](#page-45-17). This deficiency leads to challenges in maintaining the naturalness and rhythm of speech when the speed is altered through temporal distortion. Such modifications can make the speech sound unnatural or robotic, potentially degrading the training quality of speech recognition systems. Moreover, the alteration of speech speed can disrupt the acoustic cues essential for models to learn effectively, impacting their ability to perform accurately in real-world scenarios where speech tempo varies [\[205,](#page-45-16) [226\]](#page-46-13). Additionally, the modified timing can complicate the comprehension of speech by language models, as the distorted temporal features may hinder their ability to interpret syntactic and semantic information correctly. To address the temporal distortion in LLM-based audio augmentation effectively, future advancements should involve refining LLM architectures to accommodate audio-specific temporal dynamics, potentially through the integration of temporal attention mechanisms or recurrent neural network layers [\[19\]](#page-37-16). Additionally, developing hybrid models that merge LLMs with digital signal processing techniques could enhance the handling of variable speech rates, thereby preserving the naturalness of speech [\[227\]](#page-46-14). Furthermore, diversifying training datasets to include audio samples with varied speech tempos can improve model robustness, ensuring better performance across different real-world speech scenarios [\[19,](#page-37-16) [228\]](#page-46-15).
- Timbre Loss: Timbre loss represents another significant technical challenge in LLM-based audio augmentation, primarily because LLM architectures, traditionally optimized for text, do not effectively preserve the complex spectral qualities that define an audio signal's unique timbre [\[206,](#page-45-17) [229\]](#page-46-16). This limitation is critical because timbre imparts the distinct character to voices or musical sounds, which is essential for applications like speech synthesis and music generation [\[230\]](#page-46-17). The alteration of timbre during processes such as pitch shifting or speed modification can result in audio outputs that fail to replicate the original sound's perceptual attributes, thereby diminishing the authenticity and effectiveness of the augmented audio in practical applications [\[231\]](#page-46-18).

To address timbre loss in LLM-based audio augmentation, several approaches have been proposed such as Joint modeling of timbre and content [\[232\]](#page-46-19), where the system employs a joint modeling approach that integrates timbre features with both supervised and self-supervised content representations. This enhances speaker similarity and intelligibility, allowing for more accurate reproduction detailed speaker characteristics. Likewise, Conditional flow matching-based decoder can optimize the alignment between timbre and content features. This leads to more natural and accurate voice conversions, preserving timbre qualities [\[232\]](#page-46-19). Additionally, semantic-acoustic integration approach integrates both semantic and acoustic features into a unified tokenization framework. By employing a distinctive "Xshaped" structure with two inputs and two outputs, it enables simultaneous embedding learning of semantic richness and acoustic fidelity for every token. This design helps in preserving timbre information alongside semantic content [\[233\]](#page-46-20). To further address timbre loss in LLM-based audio augmentation, additional strategies could include the implementation of advanced deep learning architectures such as GANs are tailored specifically for audio

tasks. These networks can learn to generate highly realistic audio samples by training on a competitive dynamic between the generative model producing audio and the discriminative model evaluating it [\[32,](#page-38-24) [234\]](#page-46-21). Additionally, integrating multimodal data during the training phase can enhance the model's ability to understand and replicate timbre by exposing it to a broader range of audio characteristics [\[235\]](#page-46-22). Techniques like transfer learning could also be employed, where models pre-trained on vast, diverse datasets are fine-tuned with specific timbre data, improving the model's generalization capabilities to new voices or sounds while maintaining the unique timbral qualities [\[236\]](#page-47-0) .

• Feature Obfuscation : Feature obfuscation is a limitation of LLM-based speech augmentation due to the challenges it presents in preserving important speech characteristics while attempting to protect privacy or modify content. This limitation manifests in several ways such as Loss of acoustic fidelity [\[204\]](#page-45-15) and difficulty in preserving prosody [\[237\]](#page-47-1). When obfuscating features for privacy reasons, such as in speech de-identification, there's a risk of degrading the overall acoustic quality of the augmented speech [\[204\]](#page-45-15). This can impact the naturalness and intelligibility of the output. LLMs may struggle to maintain the original prosodic features of speech when augmenting or obfuscating content, potentially leading to unnatural-sounding output [\[237\]](#page-47-1). Additionally, feature obfuscation inadvertently risks obscuring critical acoustic features. For example, methods aiming to anonymize speaker identity might modify pitch or tone, potentially leading to a loss in the naturalness and expressiveness of speech [\[238\]](#page-47-2). This degradation not only affects the audio's perceptual quality but can also impair the effectiveness of speech recognition systems that rely on distinct acoustic signals for accurate processing. Furthermore, when LLMs attempt to balance feature obfuscation with maintaining intelligibility, the resulting speech might not faithfully represent the original speaker's emotional or prosodic cues, thus diminishing the listener's experience and the speech's emotional conveyance.

Addressing feature obfuscation in LLM-based speech augmentation requires a balanced approach that preserves essential speech characteristics while maintaining privacy. One effective method is the implementation of differential privacy techniques during the training phase of speech synthesis models [\[238\]](#page-47-2). This involves adding controlled noise to training data, which helps obscure individual speech features without significantly degrading overall audio quality. Additionally, advanced machine learning strategies like adversarial training can be employed, where models are trained to resist attempts at extracting specific features, thereby enhancing privacy [\[239,](#page-47-3) [240\]](#page-47-4).

• Signal Degradation : Signal degradation represents a substantial challenge and limitation in LLM-based audio or speech augmentation due to its adverse effects on the audio quality and perceptual integrity of the output. In augmentation processes that involve LLMs, signal degradation typically arises from operations such as compression, format conversion, or even the introduction of synthetic elements that can diminish the audio's natural qualities [\[241,](#page-47-5) [242\]](#page-47-6). This degradation can crucially impair the audio's clarity and fidelity, making it less suitable for applications reliant on high-quality audio inputs, such as speech recognition technologies and auditory user interfaces [\[227\]](#page-46-14). Furthermore, the authenticity and expressiveness of speech are often compromised, leading to outputs that might not accurately convey the intended emotions[\[226\]](#page-46-13).

To address the issue of signal degradation in LLM-based speech augmentation, it's essential to integrate advanced audio processing techniques that enhance signal integrity while maintaining or improving the natural characteristics of speech [\[19,](#page-37-16) [227\]](#page-46-14). One effective approach involves the use of sophisticated denoising algorithms that can remove unwanted noise

without affecting the core audio signal. Additionally, implementing dynamic range compression can help maintain audio quality by balancing the volume levels within a speech, thus preventing distortions caused by volume peaks or lows. Further advancements can be made by utilizing high-resolution signal processing techniques during the augmentation process to preserve the fine details of the speech waveform. Machine learning models, particularly those trained on a diverse set of high-quality audio samples, can be employed to learn and predict optimal signal characteristics that minimize loss during transformations.

• Synthetic Unrealism : Synthetic Unrealism poses a significant challenge in audio data augmentation using multimodal LLMs due to the potential introduction of unrealistic or inconsistent audio features [\[243\]](#page-47-7). This phenomenon can lead to the generation of augmented data that does not accurately represent real-world audio characteristics, potentially compromising the model's ability to generalize to authentic scenarios [\[244\]](#page-47-8). The issue is exacerbated by the complex nature of audio data, which encompasses various dimensions such as pitch, tempo, and timbre. LLMs, while adept at generating diverse content, may struggle to maintain the intricate relationships between these audio components, resulting in synthetic samples that lack coherence or natural acoustic properties [\[243,](#page-47-7) [245\]](#page-47-9). Furthermore, the risk of overfitting to artificially generated patterns increases, potentially leading to reduced model performance on genuine audio inputs.

To tackle the issue of synthetic unrealism in LLM-based audio data augmentation, a multifaceted approach focusing on enhancing the model's capability to generate more realistic and coherent audio samples is essential. First, integrating more comprehensive and high-fidelity training datasets can provide a richer foundation for learning authentic audio characteristics [\[246\]](#page-47-10). This can involve using recordings from diverse environments and contexts to cover a broader spectrum of real-world audio features. Secondly, applying advanced machine learning techniques such as conditional GANs (cGANs) could enforce more stringent checks on the realism of generated audio [\[31,](#page-38-3) [33\]](#page-38-4). These networks can learn to distinguish between real and synthetic audio samples, pushing the generative model to produce outputs that are indistinguishable from genuine recordings. Finally, regularizing the training process to prevent overfitting is crucial. Techniques like dropout, data augmentation (ironically), and cross-validation can be employed to ensure the LLM does not learn to replicate only the training data's patterns but can generalize well across unseen audio inputs [\[247\]](#page-47-11).

• Misalignment: Misalignment in LLM-based audio or speech data augmentation refers to discrepancies between augmented audio data and the original audio's characteristics, such as emotional tone or linguistic details [\[248\]](#page-47-12). This issue typically arises because LLMs, originally designed for text processing, may not adequately capture complex audio features like pitch, timbre, or rhythm [\[248,](#page-47-12) [249\]](#page-47-13). Such misalignment is problematic for deep learning applications reliant on precise, high-quality audio data for training. For example, in speech recognition or voice-assisted AI, misaligned data can lead to systems that misinterpret user commands or fail in real applications, reducing the reliability and effectiveness of AI interactions with human speech [\[250\]](#page-47-14).

To address misalignment in LLM-based audio augmentation for deep learning applications, future solutions should focus on enhancing model sensitivity. One effective approach is to integrate audio-specific adaptations into the LLM architectures, such as using convolutional layers that can better capture the temporal and spectral dynamics of sound [\[251\]](#page-47-15). Advanced techniques like attention mechanisms could also be employed to focus on critical features of the audio signal, improving the model's ability to retain important acoustic properties during augmentation [\[252,](#page-47-16) [253\]](#page-47-17). Moreover, incorporating multimodal training data that includes both audio and corresponding textual annotations can help improve the alignment between

the generated audio and its intended meaning [\[254\]](#page-47-18). This would enable the LLM to learn more comprehensive representations of audio features and their contextual significance. Additionally, continuous evaluation and feedback loops involving real-world testing and user input should be established to iteratively refine the models, ensuring that the audio outputs remain aligned with practical applications and user expectations.

• High Computation: LLM-based data augmentation for audio or speech is computationally intensive primarily due to the sheer size and complexity of these models. Large language models contain billions of parameters, demanding extensive memory and processing power for operations [\[97\]](#page-40-22). This computational requirement becomes a significant challenge because it necessitates the use of specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs, which can be costly and less accessible for many researchers and developers [\[255\]](#page-47-19). Moreover, the energy-intensive nature of training and deploying these models adds to their operational costs and environmental impact [\[256,](#page-47-20) [257\]](#page-47-21). This high computational demand limits the scalability of deploying LLMs for audio data augmentation, especially in environments with limited hardware resources. Additionally, the requirement for significant computational resources can impede rapid testing and iteration of models, slowing down the development cycle and innovation in audio processing applications.

To address the high computational demands of LLM-based audio augmentation, several efficiency-enhancing strategies can be implemented. Model pruning and quantization are key techniques that streamline the model by reducing parameters and computation precision, respectively, without significantly impacting performance [\[258\]](#page-48-0). Knowledge distillation transfers expertise from a large model to a smaller, more efficient one, maintaining accuracy while decreasing computational load [\[259\]](#page-48-1). Efficient hardware utilization, such as specialized neural network processors or hardware accelerators like FPGAs, can boost processing speed and reduce power consumption [\[260\]](#page-48-2). Likewise, Adaptive computing techniques adjust model complexity based on task requirements, conserving resources for simpler tasks [\[261\]](#page-48-3).

• Detail Loss: Detail loss in LLM-based audio data augmentation significantly hampers the utility of this technology due to several inherent limitations associated with audio complexity [\[207\]](#page-45-18). Audio data consists of dynamic acoustic features such as pitch, tempo, timbre, and emotional inflections, which are crucial for maintaining the authenticity of the sound [\[262\]](#page-48-4). LLMs, although capable of generating varied audio content, often struggle with preserving these intricate details. This limitation arises partly because of the inadequate representation of fine-grained features in the training datasets, which tend not to include high-quality textaudio pairs that capture detailed acoustic properties and object relationships. For instance, in speech augmentation, LLM might modify a voice's fundamental frequency but fail to retain the speaker's distinct vocal characteristics or the subtleties of their emotional tone [\[226\]](#page-46-13). Similarly, in music augmentation, critical attributes like the attack and decay phases of notes played by different instruments might be inaccurately rendered or completely lost [\[263\]](#page-48-5). Such detail loss not only diminishes the fidelity of the augmented audio compared to real-world sounds but also limits the practical applications of LLMs in fields requiring high precision in audio reproduction, such as virtual reality, filmmaking, and advanced user interfaces.

To reduce detail loss in LLM-based audio augmentation, enhancing training datasets with high-quality, diverse recordings and employing specialized neural network architectures and multi-modal learning approaches can significantly improve the model's ability to accurately generate complex audio data.

• Context Limitation: Context limitation in LLM-based speech augmentation refers to the challenge these models face in accurately understanding and generating contextually appropriate audio responses [\[264\]](#page-48-6). Unlike simple text generation, speech involves complex

elements such as tone, inflection, and rhythm, which are deeply embedded in the specific contexts of conversation or narration [\[265\]](#page-48-7). Scientifically, the main issue arises because LLMs typically generate outputs based on patterns recognized in training data, without a genuine understanding of human emotions, intentions, or the subtleties of spoken language dynamics [\[266\]](#page-48-8). This becomes a significant limitation in applications where speech needs to convey more than just words, such as in emotional speech synthesis for virtual assistants, interactive learning environments, or customer service bots. The inability to incorporate real-time context and emotional undertones often results in responses that, while grammatically correct, can seem out of place, emotionally flat, or inappropriate to human listeners.

To overcome context limitation in LLM-based speech data augmentation, future strategies should aim to enhance models' contextual and emotional understanding through advanced training methodologies and architectural improvements. Implementing context-aware training, where models are exposed to a diverse range of speech scenarios with varying emotional and situational contexts, can enrich their understanding. For example, training on datasets from theatrical dialogues or emotionally charged speeches could help models better recognize and replicate context-specific speech patterns. Additionally, integrating Emotional Neural Networks (EmoNNs), which are specially trained to recognize and replicate human emotions in speech, can significantly enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs. Multi-modal learning is another promising approach, where combining inputs like text, audio cues, and visual data such as facial expressions or gestures can deepen models' contextual comprehension. For instance, training a model using both the audio and video of a speaker can teach it to correlate speech patterns with corresponding physical expressions. Furthermore, developing adaptive models that adjust their outputs based on real-time feedback can also help. Interactive voice response systems that modify their tone in response to user emotions like frustration or happiness exemplify this approach.

#### 5.2 Future Perspectives

The future of LLM-based data augmentation spans a diverse range of innovations, as illustrated in Figure [8.](#page-36-0) Here, image augmentation techniques are projected to emphasize 3D context and multi-view data processing, supporting more realistic scene representations and advanced real-time editing pipelines. At the same time, enhanced domain specialization will drive the adaptation of augmentation strategies to particular fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, or robotics, all while maintaining semantic consistency through robust validation mechanisms. Similarly, text augmentation is set to benefit from fact-based, knowledge-grounded generation, improving the reliability and interpretability of synthetic text. This is especially pertinent in multilingual low-resource contexts, where LLMs could fill data gaps for underrepresented languages, all the while supporting fine-grained style and emotion control to produce more expressive outputs and on-the-fly language adaptation in real-world communication systems.

In the realm of speech augmentation, emotion and prosody preservation will be key to delivering authentic, human-like audio data, making voice-based AI more natural and empathetic. Highfidelity timbre retention likewise remains an open challenge, especially for sensitive applications such as assistive speech devices and high-end multimedia production. Augmentation tailored to context-aware accent integration promises a more inclusive approach, broadening AI's reach across diverse linguistic communities. Finally, robust streaming augmentation methods could enable realtime transformations of audio for live scenarios, such as simultaneous interpretation or interactive voice assistants.

Additionally, the advent of reinforcement learning-based methodologies such as DeepSeek R1 heralds a transformative shift in LLM based data augmentation [\[267\]](#page-48-9). Traditionally, LLMs have been dependent on large, meticulously annotated datasets, which can restrict their adaptability and scope for innovation. However, DeepSeek R1 shifts away from this reliance by using reinforcement learning (RL) to enable models to continuously learn and evolve autonomously by interacting with their environment and adjusting based on feedback. This shift is particularly transformative for data augmentation strategies. Reinforcement learning allows models like DeepSeek R1 to not only generate their own data but also to continuously refine this data in response to new challenges and feedback. This dynamic approach to data generation represents a significant move away from static, pre-labeled datasets, reducing costs and dependency on human annotation. The implications for data augmentation are profound. As models become capable of self-augmentation, they can explore a broader range of scenarios and adapt to complex, unforeseen challenges more effectively than models restricted by their initial training data. This not only enhances the flexibility and depth of the models' knowledge but also opens up new possibilities for efficiency in model training. As reinforcement learning continues to advance, it is set to reshape the landscape of data augmentation, promising a future where AI systems are more robust, context-aware, and adaptable. This development indicates a new era where LLMs can surpass traditional capabilities, driven by their ability to learn independently and innovate beyond the boundaries of their initial programming.
