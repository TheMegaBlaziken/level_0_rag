In this paper we investigate the relation between the scaling properties of the linear response function R(t, s), of the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and of the zero field cooled magnetization (ZFC) in the context of phase ordering kinetics. We explain why the retrival of the scaling properties of R(t, s) from those of TRM and ZFC is not trivial. Preasymptotic contributions generate a long crossover in TRM, while ZFC is affected by a dangerous irrelevant variable. Lack of understanding of both these points has generated some confusion in the literature. The full picture relating the exponents of all the quantities involved is explicitely illustrated in the framework of the large N model. Following this scheme, an assessment of the present status of numerical simulations for the Ising model can be made. We reach the conclusion that on the basis of the data available up to now, statements on the scaling properties of R(t, s) can be made from ZFC but not from TRM. From ZFC data for the Ising model with d = 2, 3, 4 we confirm the previously found linear dependence on dimensionality of the exponent a entering R(t, s) ∼ s −(1+a) f(t/s). We also find evidence that a recently derived form of the scaling function f(x), using local scale invariance arguments [M.Henkel, M.Pleimling, C.Godr`eche and J.M.Luck, Phys.Rev.Lett. 87, 265701 (2001)], does not hold for the Ising model.

### I. INTRODUCTION

The behavior of systems out of equilibrium is a subject of wide current interest [1]. Most of the attention is focused on glassy or disordered systems. Nonetheless, many of the interesting features of slow relaxation, such as aging, can be studied also in the simpler context of a phase ordering process. This is the dynamical process which takes place, for instance, when a ferromagnet is suddenly cooled from above to below the critical point. Then, ordered regions grow by coarsening. The process is slow, i.e. the typical size of these regions grows with the power law L(t) ∼ t 1/z , where z is the dynamic exponent. For dynamics with non conserved order parameter (NCOP), as it will be considered in this paper, z = 2 independent of dimensionality. In an infinite system equilibrium is never reached. Phase ordering has been studied for a long time now [2]. However, despite its relative simplicity when compared to the complexity of glassy behavior, still there remains lack of consensus and considerable confusion about the properties of the off equilibrium response function. This paper is devoted to clarify the issue. This is a problem not of minor importance, given that phase ordering is regarded as a paradigmatic example of out of equilibrium behavior.

For definiteness, let us think of an Ising ferromagnet with Hamiltonian

$$
\mathcal{H}[\sigma] = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma_i \sigma_j \tag{1}
$$

initially prepared at very high temperature and quenched at the time t = 0 to a final temperature T < T<sup>C</sup> . In a process of this type the initial magnetization is zero and remains zero at all times hσi(t)i = 0 for t ≥ 0. Quantities of interest are [3] the autocorrelation function

$$
C(t, s, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \langle \sigma_i(t)\sigma_i(s) \rangle \tag{2}
$$

where t ≥ s ≥ 0 are two times after the quench and the linear (auto)response function

$$
R(t, s, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \left. \frac{\partial \langle \sigma_i(t) \rangle}{\partial h_i(s)} \right|_{h=0} \tag{3}
$$

where hi(s) is the external field conjugated to the order parameter. Traditionally, in phase ordering studies most of the attention has been devoted to the correlation function [2], while the response function has remained in the background.

In addition to the two observation times t and s, in Eq.s (1) and (2) we have explicitly indicated also a dependence on the following characteristic times

- t<sup>0</sup> ∼ Λ −z . This is a microscopic time related, through the dynamic exponent z, to such a microscopic length as the lattice spacing or the inverse momentum cutoff Λ−<sup>1</sup> .
- tsc. The process of phase ordering is characterized by dynamical scaling in the asymptotic time region (or late stage). The characteristic time tsc separates the preasymptotic from the asymptotic regime, i.e. it gives a measure of how much time is needed after the quench for scaling to set in.
- teq. After the formation of domains of ordered regions, equilibrium is rapidly reached in the interior of domains. The characteristic time needed to establish this local equilibrium is the same as the equilibration time in the pure ordered phases. It is given by teq ∼ ξ z , where ξ is the equilibrium correlation length in the pure phases at the final temperature T and z is the dynamic exponent introduced above.

The correlation and response function can always be written as the sum of two contributions [3]

$$
C(t, s, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = C_{st}(t - s, t_0, t_{eq}) + C_{ag}(t, s, t_0, t_{sc})
$$
\n(4)

$$
R(t, s, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = R_{st}(t - s, t_0, t_{eq}) + R_{ag}(t, s, t_0, t_{sc})
$$
\n
$$
(5)
$$

where the stationary contributions are what one has in equilibrium in the pure phases. Therefore, the usual fluctuation dissipation theorem is satisfied

$$
R_{st}(t-s,t_0,t_{eq}) = \frac{1}{T} \frac{\partial C_{st}(t-s,t_0,t_{eq})}{\partial s}.
$$
\n
$$
(6)
$$

The rest, the aging contributions Cag(t, s, t0, tsc) and Rag(t, s, t0, tsc), are what is left over due to the existence of slow out of equilibrium degrees of freedom. The above split is useful for s sufficiently large, i.e. for

$$
s \gg t_{eq} \tag{7}
$$

in order to have well separated time scales for equilibrium and non equilibrium behavior and for

$$
s \gg t_{sc} \tag{8}
$$

in order for Cag(t, s, t0, tsc) and Rag(t, s, t0.tsc) to exhibit scaling behavior.

In connection with the aging contributions there are two basic questions

- i) how do Cag(t, s, t0, tsc) and Rag(t, s, t0, tsc) scale in the late stage
- ii) what is the relation between Cag(t, s, t0, tsc) and Rag(t, s, t0, tsc), if any.

The second question belongs to the general area of the out of equilibrium generalization of the fluctuation dissipation theorem [4]. This is a problem not as trivial as it is believed to be for phase ordering systems [5,6], with interesting implications on the connection between statics and dynamics [7]. In this paper we concentrate on the first question which is preliminary to the second one.

Assuming that s is large enough for (7) and (8) to be satisfied and dropping tsc, the scaling form of Cag(t, s, t0) is given by

$$
C_{ag}(t, s, t_0) \sim s^{-b} g(t/s, t_0/s).
$$
\n(9)

It is well known [2] that b = 0. Furthermore, for s ≫ t<sup>0</sup> one can set y = 0 in g(x, y) and it is also well known that for x ≫ 1 one has g(x, 0) = g(x) ∼ x <sup>−</sup>λ/z, where λ is the Fisher-Huse exponent. Information about Rag(t, s, t0), instead, is scanty. Writing the scaling relation analogous to Eq. (9) in the form

$$
R_{ag}(t, s, t_0) = s^{-(1+a)} f(t/s, t_0/s)
$$
\n(10)

both a and f(x, y) are much less known than b and g(x, y). Despite considerable efforts, no consensus has been reached as of yet on the value of a. The situation for the scaling function f(x, y) is not much better. Recently, Henkel, Pleimling, Godr`eche and Luck (HPGL) [8], using local scale invariance [9], have derived an explicit form of the scaling function which is supposed to be of general validity. However, under close scrutiny this form appears neither to be obeyed in those cases where an exact solution is available, nor to fit numerical data for Ising systems, as it will be shown in section III.

There is more than one reason for such an unsatisfactory state of affairs. The first one is due to a qualitative analysis [10] of the relation between the response function and the density of defects. A naive use of this argument leads to the conclusion that a is independent of dimensionality, e.g. for scalar systems a = 1/z. In this form, due to its simplicity, this argument has become deeply rooted in the literature [7,12,13], despite the accumulation of exact [14–16], approximated [5,13] and numerical results [5,17,18] incompatible with it. As we shall see, Rag(t, s, t0) is trivial in the sense that is proportional to the defect density only in the short time regime, but in no case this implies that a is independent of dimensionality. Another reason is that in simulations Rag(t, s, t0) is too noisy to work with and, in order to deal with more manageable quantities, one must resort to the integrated response functions (IRF). The price for this is that reconstructing the scaling properties of Rag(t, s, t0) from those of an IRF is not as simple as it might look at first sight [18]. This will be the main theme of the paper.

We will show that, through the combined use of exact results and numerical simulations, definite conclusions can be reached for the exponent a by analysing in detail what actually goes on in the different methods employed to evaluate it. For what concerns the scaling function f(x, y), instead, our understanding of the problem remains incomplete.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we review existing information about Rag(t, s, t0), we make general considerations on the scaling function and we comment on the HPGL theory. In section III we analyse the problem of retriving the properties of Rag(t, s, t0) from those of an IRF concentrating on the zero field cooled magnetization. Section IV is devoted to the same problem from the side of the thermoremanent magnetization. In section V we use the solution of the large N model as an explicit illustration clarifying what goes on when different IRF are employed to obtain information on Rag(t, s, t0). Concluding remarks are made in section VI.

### II. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT RAG

This paper is devoted to the study of the exponent a and the scaling function f(x, y) entering Eq. (10). We first summarise what is known from exact and approximate analytical results providing direct access to Rag(t, s, t0). We, then, make general considerations on f(x, y) and some remarks on the HPGL form for it.

Ising model d=1

In the exact analytical computation of the response function [14,15] in the d = 1 kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics, after taking s ≫ tsc and neglecting t0/s one finds

$$
R_{ag}(t,s) \sim s^{-1}(t/s-1)^{-1/2} \tag{11}
$$

from which follows

a = 0 (12)

and

$$
f(x,0) \sim (x-1)^{-1/2}.\tag{13}
$$

Furthermore, the correlation function is given by [19,20]

$$
C(t,s) = \frac{2}{\pi} \arcsin \sqrt{\frac{2}{1+t/s}}
$$
\n(14)

which gives C(t, s) ∼ (t/s) −1/2 for t/s ≫ 1. Hence, recalling z = 2, one has λ = 1 and Eq. (13) can be rewritten as

$$
f(x,0) \sim \frac{x^{a+1/2 - \lambda/z}}{(x-1)^{a+1/2}}.\tag{15}
$$

It should be mentioned that a = 0 has been found numerically also in the case of the kinetic Ising chain with Kawasaki dynamics [21].

## Large N model

Solving analytically the large N model we have found [16] (see also section V) Rag(t, s, t0) of the form (10) with

$$
a = (d-2)/2\tag{16}
$$

and

$$
f(x,y) \sim \frac{x^{a+1-\lambda/z} - 1}{(x-1+y)^{a+1}}\tag{17}
$$

where d is arbitrary and λ = d/2. Notice that a = 0 for d = 2.

## Gaussian auxiliary field (GAF) approximation

Berthier, Barrat and Kurchan [13] have calculated analytically an IRF using a GAF approximation based on the Ohta-Jasnow-Kawasaki method [2]. From their computation it is easy to extract Rag(t, s, t0) which is in the form (10) with

$$
a = (d-1)/2\tag{18}
$$

and

$$
f(x,y) \sim \frac{x^{a+1/2 - \lambda/z}}{(x-1+y)^{a+1/2}}
$$
\n(19)

with λ = d/2. Their calculation involves a diffusion constant of the form D = (d − 1)/d which prevents letting d → 1, so they consider d ≥ 2. We have worked out [5] an alternative GAF approximation, without restriction on dimensionality, which extends Eq.s (18) and (19) to d ≥ 1. Then, we recover a = 0 for d = 1 as in the Ising case.

### A. General form of f(x, y) and implications for Rag(t, s, t0)

All the above results for f(x, y) are of the form

$$
f(x,y) \sim \frac{x^{-\beta} - \epsilon}{(x - 1 + y)^{\alpha}}
$$
\n(20)

where ǫ = 0 if the correlation length in the low temperature pure phase is finite, like in the d = 1 Ising model and in the GAF approximation, or ǫ = 1 if the low temperature phase is critical [22] like in the large N model [16] (see also section V).

We now make the phenomenological assumption that Eq. (20) is valid in general. Then the task becomes that of finding the exponents a, α and β. For this it is useful to look at the short and long time behaviors.

Short time behavior

Let us rewrite Rag(t, s, t0) introducing the time difference τ = t − s in Eq. (20)

$$
R_{ag}(t,s,t_0) = s^{\alpha - (1+a)} \left[ \frac{(\tau/s + 1)^{-\beta} - \epsilon}{(\tau + t_0)^{\alpha}} \right].
$$
\n(21)

Keeping τ fixed and letting s to become large, to lowest order in τ /s we find

$$
R_{ag}(t,s,t_0) \sim s^{-\delta} \left[ \frac{\tau^{\epsilon}}{(\tau + t_0)^{\alpha}} \right]
$$
\n(22)

with

$$
\delta = (1 + a) - (\alpha - \epsilon) \tag{23}
$$

and where ǫ is the same as in Eq. (20). Therefore, from the short time behavior one can extract δ. An important observation is that in the three explicit cases considered above δ coincides with the exponent entering in the time dependence of the density of defects. At the time s, this is given by

$$
L(s)^{-n} \sim s^{-n/z} \tag{24}
$$

where L(s) and z are the domain size and the dynamic exponent introduced above, n = 1 for N = 1, n = 2 for N > 1 and N is the number of components of the order parameter [2]. One can, then, immediately verify that

$$
\delta = n/z. \tag{25}
$$

In the d = 1 Ising model and in the GAF approximation where ǫ = 0 and

$$
\alpha = a + 1/2 \tag{26}
$$

from Eq. (23) we get δ = 1/2, while in the large N model with ǫ = 1 and

$$
\alpha = a + 1 \tag{27}
$$

we get δ = 1.

Long time behavior

In the large time regime t/s ≫ 1, from Eq.s (10) and (20) follows

$$
R_{ag}(t, s, t_0) \sim s^{-(1+a)}(t/s)^{-\lambda_R/z}
$$
\n(28)

with

$$
\lambda_R/z = \alpha + \beta. \tag{29}
$$

Summarising, the exponents a, α and β can be obtained, in principle, by making three different measurements on Rag(t, s, t0):

- 1. s dependence for fixed t/s gives a (from Eq. (10))
- 2. s dependence for fixed τ gives δ (from Eq. (22))
- 3. t dependence for fixed s gives λR/z (from Eq. (28)).

Before going into this, let us comment on the form of the scaling function derived by HPGL in Ref. [8].

## B. Response function from local scale invariance

Without making the separation (5) between stationary and aging components and neglecting the dependence on t0, HPGL assume that the full response function R(t, s) obeys the scaling form

$$
R(t,s) \sim s^{-(1+a)} f_{HPGL}(t/s). \tag{30}
$$

Then, using local scale invariance arguments they make the prediction that in general, for phase ordering, one has

$$
f_{HPGL}(x) \sim \frac{x^{a+1-\lambda/z}}{(x-1)^{a+1}}
$$
\n(31)

where λ is the Fisher-Huse exponent, provided there are no long range correlations in the initial condition. In support of (31) they invoke the exact solution of the spherical model [23–25], which is equivalent to the large N model, and numerical simulations for the Ising model with d=2 and d=3. We make the following comments

- in the spherical or large N model Eq. (31) ideed reproduces the full response function. This coincides with the aging contribution (17) for x ≫ 1 but not for x ≃ 1. This difference will turn out to be important (see section V).
- Eq. (31) is contained in the general form (20) with ǫ = 0, β = λ/z − (a + 1) and α = a + 1. Inserting into Eq. (23) follows that in all cases one should have δ = 0. Furthermore, one should also have α = a + 1 always, while from the explicit examples considered above this is true only in the large N case and not in the d = 1 Ising model or in the GAF approximation.
- HPGL theory is supposed to hold also for quenches at TC. In that case the validity of Eq. (31) has been questioned in the framework of the field theoretic ǫ-expansion for the response function [26].
- About the support to Eq. (31) from numerical simulations we will comment below.

Now, in order to go beyond the explicitely solvable cases, the problem is to determine the exponents a, α and β in the Ising model with d > 1. As stated in the Introduction, measurement of Rag(t, s, t0) is too noisy, so the program outlined above in subsection II A on the basis of Eq.s (22) and (28) requires an unrealistically long computing time. In the next section we discuss how to proceed with the help of IRF.

### III. ZERO FIELD COOLED MAGNETIZATION

Indirect information on Rag(t, s, t0) comes from numerical results on IRF. In general, an IRF is defined by

$$
\mu(t, t_2, t_1, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} ds R(t, s, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq})
$$
\n(32)

with t ≥ t<sup>2</sup> ≥ t<sup>1</sup> ≥ 0 and using (5) one has

$$
\mu(t, t_2, t_1, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \mu_{st}(t - t_2, t - t_1, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) + \mu_{ag}(t, t_2, t_1, t_0, t_{sc}).
$$
\n(33)

We will concentrate on the second contribution in the right hand side. The reason for introducing an IRF is that the integration over (t1, t2) lowers the noise. However, if one has to resort to an IRF, there is the related problem of retriving the properties of R(t, s) from it. This is not straightforward. IRF usually employed are

1. the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM)

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \mu(t, t_2 = t_w, t_1 = 0, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq})
$$
\n(34)

obtained by looking at the response at the time t to an external field acting in the interval (0, tw)

2. the zero field cooled magnetization (ZFC)

$$
\chi(t, t_w, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq}) = \mu(t, t_2 = t, t_1 = t_w, t_0, t_{sc}, t_{eq})
$$
\n(35)

obtained by looking at the response at the time t when the field acts in the interval (tw, t).

Both these quantities do have shortcomings. For TRM the problem is evident. The integration starts at t<sup>1</sup> = 0, so preasymptotic contributions are always included. The dependence on tsc cannot be neglected and this turns out to make it particularly hard to extract the asymptotic behavior in the cases of interest.

With ZFC there is not such a problem. Taking t<sup>w</sup> ≫ tsc, and neglecting tsc thereafter, one can be confident to be in the asymptotic region where scaling holds. So, using (10) with f(x, y) of the general form (20) and considering the case with ǫ = 0, one has

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w, t_0) = t_w^{-a} F(t/t_w, t_0/t_w)
$$
\n(36)

with

$$
F(x,y) = x^{-a} \int_{1/x}^{1} dz \frac{z^{\beta + \alpha - (a+1)}}{(1 - z + y/x)^{\alpha}}.
$$
\n(37)

The first observation is that if one seeks to determine a from Eq. (36) by looking at the behavior of χag as t<sup>w</sup> is varied and x = t/t<sup>w</sup> is kept fixed, one must be aware that the t<sup>w</sup> dependence coming from t0/t<sup>w</sup> may play a role. In other words y = t0/t<sup>w</sup> may act as a dangerous irrelevant variable. Namely, defining the exponent a<sup>χ</sup> by

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w) \sim t_w^{-a_\chi} \hat{\chi}(x) \tag{38}
$$

there may be a difference between a in Eq. (36) and a<sup>χ</sup> in Eq. (38). This depends on whether the integral in Eq. (37) diverges or not at the upper limit of integration as y → 0. This, in turn, depends on the value of α. The second observation is that α can be extracted from the large x behavior of F(x, y), as we shall see in the following. Instead, the task of extracting β from Eq. (37) remains exceedingly complicated.

### A. The exponents a and a<sup>χ</sup>

The possibility that a<sup>χ</sup> might not be identifiable with a, due to the presence of y = t0/tw, can be checked explicitely in the large N model [16] and in the GAF approximation [5,13], where ZFC can be calculated with arbitrary d. In both cases there is a value d<sup>χ</sup> of the dimensionality such that y is dangerous irrelevant above dχ. This implies that a<sup>χ</sup> coincides with a for d < d<sup>χ</sup> and is given by Eq.s (16) and (18). Instead, a<sup>χ</sup> is different from a and is given by

$$
a_{\chi} = \delta \tag{39}
$$

for d > d<sup>χ</sup> with δ given by Eq. (25), which is independent of dimensionality. Logarithmic corrections appear at d = dχ, much in the same way as at the upper critical dimensionality in ordinary critical phenomena. The relation between a<sup>χ</sup> and a in these two models is given by

$$
a_{\chi} = \begin{cases} a & \text{for } d < d_{\chi} \\ \delta & \text{with log corrections for } d = d_{\chi} \\ \delta & \text{for } d > d_{\chi} \end{cases}
$$
 (40)

with δ = 1 and d<sup>χ</sup> = 4 in the large N model and with δ = 1/2 and d<sup>χ</sup> = 2 in the GAF approximation. We emphasize that in these two solvable cases, Eq. (39) holds only for d > d<sup>χ</sup> where a<sup>χ</sup> 6= a.

Next, from extensive numerical simulations [17,5,18] of the Glauber-Ising model with d = 2, 3, 4 we have measured a<sup>χ</sup> obtaining data which are fairly well consistent (Fig. 1) with the phenomenological formula

$$
a_{\chi} = \begin{cases} (d-1)/4 & \text{for} \quad d < 3\\ 1/2 & \text{with log corrections for} \quad d = 3\\ 1/2 & \text{for} \quad d > 3. \end{cases} \tag{41}
$$

Since in the scalar case δ = 1/2, it is evident that the pattern (40) is followed also in the Ising model with d<sup>χ</sup> = 3.

We may, then, conclude that in all cases: exact, approximate and numerical a<sup>χ</sup> is given by Eq. (40) and that, therefore, the exponent a obeys the general formula

$$
a = \delta \frac{d - d_L}{d_\chi - d_L} \tag{42}
$$

where d<sup>L</sup> is the dimensionality where a = 0. According to this picture, the distinction among the different systems comes through the values of δ, dχ, d<sup>L</sup> (see Table I).

|    | Ising | GAF | N = ∞ |  |  |  |  |
|----|-------|-----|-------|--|--|--|--|
| δ  | 1/2   | 1/2 | 1     |  |  |  |  |
| dL | 1     | 1   | 2     |  |  |  |  |
| dχ | 3     | 2   | 4     |  |  |  |  |
|    |       |     |       |  |  |  |  |

TABLE I.

In this respect, notice that for N = 1 both from simulations and from GAF one has δ = 1/2 and d<sup>L</sup> = 1, while there is a discrepancy between d<sup>χ</sup> = 3 and d<sup>χ</sup> = 2. However, this is not worrysome. As explained in Ref. [5], the dimensionality dependence of a<sup>χ</sup> below d<sup>χ</sup> takes place because d<sup>χ</sup> is the dimensionality below which minimization of magnetic energy competes effectively with minimization of surface tension in driving interface motion. Therefore, the balance of these two mechanisms is very sensitive to the treatment of surface tension and it should not come as a surprise that from an uncontrolled approximation, such as are those of the GAF type, a value of d<sup>χ</sup> which differs from the one observed in simulations is obtained. The shift from d<sup>χ</sup> = 3 to d<sup>χ</sup> = 2 means that in the GAF approximation surface tension is overestimated with respect to simulations.

# B. The scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x) and the exponent <sup>α</sup>

Although the results described above [17,5,18] yield unequivocally d<sup>χ</sup> = 3 for N = 1, in order to treat this point most carefully, we have investigated anew the behavior of χag(t, tw) with very accurate simulations of the Ising model with NCOP, <sup>d</sup> = 2, <sup>3</sup>, 4 and for different values of <sup>t</sup><sup>w</sup> in order to get data also on the scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x), which has not been studied previously.

First, let us illustrate the algorithm. There are several ways to isolate the aging contribution χag(t, tw). The most obvious is to compute the total χ(t, tw) by simulating a quenched system and then to subtract from it the stationary part χst(t, tw) obtained by simulation of a system in equilibrium at the final temperature of the quench. A different algorithm was introduced by Derrida [27] regarding the stationary contribution as due to thermal fluctuations inside the bulk of domains and the aging part as produced from the interfaces. The next step is to isolate the spins belonging to an interface. In order to do this a parallel simulation is performed of two systems with different initial conditions. The first is prepared in equilibrium at the initial temperature and then is quenched to the final temperature T , while the second is in equilibrium at the final temperature T from the beginning. These two systems evolve with the same thermal history at the temperature T . At each time step spins that are flipped in the first system but not in the second are considered as interfacial and their response is assigned to the aging part.

These two methods are equivalent, but also numerically very inefficient. Let us refer to them as global methods. The reason for inefficiency is that in order to extract the response produced by the spins on the interfaces one has to simulate the whole lattice. Since the interface density decreases as t <sup>−</sup>1/z a huge amount of cpu time can be saved by an algorithm updating only the interfacial spins. We stress that a fast algorithm is crucial in order to have reliable results in a numerically hard problem such as this. Therefore, we have adopted a no bulk flip algorithm, where a list of interfacial spins is updated at each move following the criterion that a spin belongs to an interface if at least one of the nearest neighbourghs is not aligned. Only moves of the interfacial spins are allowed. We then take the response of this system as χag(t, tw).

In d = 1 it can be shown [14] that the no bulk flip algorithm corresponds to taking the limit of an infinite ferromagnetic coupling (J → ∞) in the Ising Hamiltonian and that this isolates exactly the aging part of the response function. With d > 1 the J → ∞ limit and the no bulk flip algorithm produce different dynamical evolutions and an argument analogous to the one in the d = 1 case cannot be made. What happens is that the limit J → ∞ does not isolate χag(t, tw) because, besides freezing spins in the bulk, it also freezes most of the interfacial spins. Notice that the no bulk flip dynamics does not obey detailed balance. This is simply due to the fact that bulk spins are frozen. However, this is not a serious problem since we already know that by restoring moves in the bulk detailed balance is recovered producing the stationary contribution in the response function, which we are not interested in.

We have performed the simulations with the no bulk flip algorithm, after checking that the results are consistent within 5 per cent with those of the global algorithms. In practice, we measure the quantity

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}h_0^2} \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{N}} \overline{\langle \sigma_i \rangle h_i}
$$
\n(43)

where h<sup>i</sup> is a quenched configuration of an uncorrelated random field, which takes the values ±h<sup>0</sup> with probability 1/2. The angular brakets stand for the average over thermal histories, generated with the no bulk flip algorithm, and the overbar denotes the average over random field configurations. Simulations have been performed at T /T<sup>C</sup> = 0.66 for all values of d (for the lattice size and the number of realizations see Table II). χag(t, tw) is measured in units J −1 and time in units of Monte Carlo steps. For each thermal history we have changed also the random field configuration.

TABLE II. Lattice size N and number of realizations in the computation of χag(t, tw) at different waiting times

First, we have obtained a<sup>χ</sup> by plotting χag(t, tw) versus tw, for fixed values of x = t/tw. In the range of t<sup>w</sup> explored there is excellent power law behavior. With x = 7 we find (Fig. 2) a<sup>χ</sup> = 0.28 for d = 2, a<sup>χ</sup> = 0.47 for d = 3 and a<sup>χ</sup> = 0.50 for d = 4. These numbers reproduce the results obtained previously [17,5,18] confirming that a<sup>χ</sup> in the Ising model obeys closely Eq.s (40) and (42) with δ = 1/2, d<sup>χ</sup> = 3 and d<sup>L</sup> = 1 (see also Fig. 1). Furthermore, the observed behavior is with good accuracy independent of x, as it is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The presence of a logarithmic correction at d = 3 is hard to establish from the data of Fig. 2 since we have only one decade in tw. In Ref.s [17,5] where χag(t, tw) was plotted against t for fixed t<sup>w</sup> over four decades, the logarithmic behavior is accessible. Also, it should be mentioned that Eq. (41) is a phenomenological formula, so it is hard to say whether the measured value a<sup>χ</sup> = 0.47 for d = 3 is due to logarithmic corrections or to some other effect not captured by Eq. (41). In any case, the quality of the data for d = 2 allows to definitely rule out a<sup>χ</sup> = 0.5, predicted by the qualitative argument referred to in the Introduction and to be discussed shortly.

**Caption:** Figure 2 shows the aging contribution χag(t, tw) plotted against tw for fixed x = t/tw. The slope of the curves yields the effective exponent aχ, with values indicated in the inset. The data suggest a consistent power law behavior across different dimensionalities, reinforcing the findings on aging dynamics.

FIG. 2. χag(t, tw) versus t<sup>w</sup> for fixed x = t/tw. The slope yields aχ. The plotted lines correspond to x = 7. Values of a<sup>χ</sup> for different values of x are depicted in the inset.

Next, in order to investigate the scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x) in Eq. (38), notice that from Eq.s (36) and (37) follows the large x behavior

$$
\widehat{\chi}(x) \sim \begin{cases}\n x^{-a} & \text{for } \alpha < 1 \\
 x^{-a} \log x & \text{for } \alpha = 1 \\
 x^{\alpha - a - 1} & \text{for } \alpha > 1\n\end{cases}\n\tag{44}
$$

Using the values of a<sup>χ</sup> from Fig. 2, we have plotted t a<sup>χ</sup> <sup>w</sup> χag(t, tw) versus x = t/t<sup>w</sup> for different values of t<sup>w</sup> (Fig.s 3,4,5).

**Caption:** Figure 3 presents the scaling function χb(x) for the d = 2 Ising model at T/Tc = 0.66. The data collapse indicates a power law decay consistent with the exponent aχ, confirming the scaling behavior of the aging contribution in this system.

![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 4 depicts the scaling function χb(x) for the d = 3 Ising model with T/Tc = 0.66. The observed data collapse supports the power law behavior, further validating the relationship between the scaling function and the aging dynamics in higher dimensions.

FIG. 4. Scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x) for the <sup>d</sup> = 3 Ising model with T /T<sup>C</sup> = 0.66.

![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 5 illustrates the scaling function χb(x) for the d = 4 Ising model at T/Tc = 0.66. The data collapse confirms the expected power law decay, consistent with the theoretical predictions regarding the aging behavior in this dimensionality.

FIG. 5. Scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x) for the <sup>d</sup> = 4 Ising model with T /T<sup>C</sup> = 0.66.

Collapse of the data is obtained for x sufficiently large, where the scaling function decays with a power law and an exponent which coincides with aχ. This is consistent with Eq. (44) only if α = a + 1/2 as in Eq. (26) and this rules out α = a + 1, which ought to apply according to the HPGL theory. Another way to see that α = a + 1 is untenable is that this would imply that <sup>χ</sup>b(x) goes to a constant for large <sup>x</sup> when α > 1. This, in turn, would lead to the unphisical conclusion that χag(t, tw) does not decay to zero for large t and fixed t<sup>w</sup> when d > dχ. Therefore, we find that Eq. (26) holds for the Ising model not only for d = 1, but also at higher dimensionality.

In conclusion, Eq.s (42) and (26) are our main results for a and α in the Ising model with d ranging from 1 to 4 and with Eq. (40) explaining how a is related to aχ.

### C. Qualitative conjecture on a<sup>χ</sup>

We may now comment on the qualitative conjecture mentioned in the Introduction. Stating [10,7] that the aging contribution of ZFC ought to be proportional to the density of defects and assuming scaling, one finds

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w) \sim t_w^{-\delta} \widehat{\chi}(t/t_w) \tag{45}
$$

where δ is given by Eq. (25). This requires a<sup>χ</sup> = δ for all d contrary to the evidence presented above and summarised in Eq. (40), which restricts the validity of Eq. (39) to d > dχ. This makes a big difference, for instance, in the d = 2 Ising model where from Eq. (40) a<sup>χ</sup> = 1/4, while from the above Eq.(45) follows a<sup>χ</sup> = 1/2. In order to understand why Eq. (45) breaks down below dχ, let us go back to the behavior of Rag(t, s, t0) in the short time regime. From Eq. (22) we may write

$$
R_{ag}(t, s, t_0) \sim s^{-\delta} h(\tau, t_0) \tag{46}
$$

where h(τ, t0) is some function of the time difference. The meaning of this is that the response, due to an impulsive perturbation at the time s, is proportional to the density of defects at that instant of time with a proportionality factor containing the retardation effect. This does not hold anymore in the long time regme τ ≫ s. When the time interval τ is large with respect to s, multiple defect transits may have occurred through the observation site, spoiling the form (46). Sticking to the short time regime, i.e. taking t − t<sup>w</sup> ≪ t<sup>w</sup> and using Eq. (46), from the definition (35) follows

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w) \sim t_w^{-\delta} \chi_s(t - t_w) \tag{47}
$$

where χs(t − tw) is a function of the time difference, which in Ref.s [5,17] we have identified with the ZFC associated to a single defect. Now, Eq.s (47) and (45) do require

$$
\widehat{\chi}(t/t_w) \sim \chi_s(t-t_w) \tag{48}
$$

which can hold only if both functions are constant. And this is precisely the point. As we have explained in Ref.s [5,17] χs(t−tw) contains the cumulative effect on a single defect of the perturbation acting all along the time interval (tw, t). This saturates rapidly to a constant when the defect degrees of freedom act paramagnetically and the underlying defect motion is uncorrelated with the external field. However, at dimensionalities low enough to reduce surface tension below the threashold where the external field may take part in driving defect motion, χs(t − tw) acquires a non trivial time dependence which renders a<sup>χ</sup> 6= δ for d < dχ. Finally, notice that in the framework of the qualitative conjecture with a<sup>χ</sup> = δ independent of dimensionality, there is no explanation for the exact d = 1 result a<sup>χ</sup> = 0. Instead, according to Eq. (41) this exact result, far from being an anomaly, is embedded as a limiting behavior in the smooth dimensionality dependence for d < 3.

## IV. TRM

Dealing with TRM, the separation (33) gives ρ(t, s) = R <sup>t</sup><sup>w</sup> <sup>0</sup> <sup>R</sup>st(<sup>t</sup> <sup>−</sup> <sup>s</sup>) + <sup>R</sup> <sup>t</sup><sup>w</sup> <sup>0</sup> Rag(t, s). Contrary to what happens for ZFC, where χst for long time saturates to a constant, here for the stationary contribution there are two possibilities: i) if Rst(t − s) decays exponentially ρst(t − tw) also decays exponentially or ii) if Rst(t − s) decays with a power law, like in the large N model, ρst(t − tw) is subdominant with respect to ρag(t, tw). In both cases we can neglect ρst and with it the distinction between ρ and ρag.

As mentioned previously, TRM is affected by preasymptotic contributions which cannot be eliminated. This makes it quite difficult to establish if the asymptotic behavior has been reached in the simulations and ultimately to have a reliable estimate of a. In order to unravel what is the effect of the preasymptotic contributions on the scaling behavior of TRM, we have resorted as a guide to the solution of the large N model (section V). Here, we anticipate the results.

Assuming t<sup>w</sup> > tsc, in the large N case there exists a dimensionality d<sup>ρ</sup> = 4 such that for d < d<sup>ρ</sup> TRM undergoes a crossover with a characteristic time t ∗ , which may also be much larger than tsc. Introducing the effective exponent

$$
a_{\rho,eff} = -\frac{\partial \log \rho(t, t_w, t^*)}{\partial \log t_w}\bigg|_{t/t_w}
$$
\n(49)

one finds

$$
a_{\rho,eff} = \begin{cases} \lambda/z & \text{for } t_w \ll t^*\\ a & \text{for } t_w \gg t^*. \end{cases}
$$
 (50)

For d = d<sup>ρ</sup> there is a crossover from a pure power law to a power law with logarithmic correction

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*) = \begin{cases} t_w^{-\lambda/z} E(t/t_w) & \text{for} \qquad t_w \ll t^* \\ t_w^{-\lambda/z} \log(t_w/t_{sc}) E(t/t_w) & \text{for} \qquad t_w \gg t^*. \end{cases}
$$
(51)

Finally, for d > d<sup>ρ</sup> one has the simple power law

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*) = t_w^{-\lambda/z} E(t/t_w)
$$
\n(52)

and for all values of d, in the time regime considered the scaling function obeys

$$
E(x) \sim x^{-\lambda/z}.\tag{53}
$$

Taking this pattern as a guide (with dρ, t <sup>∗</sup> and exponents model dependent) let us now turn to simulations of the Ising model. Analysing data, the first thing to do is to check if a behavior of the type

$$
\rho(t, t_w) \sim t_w^{-a_p} \widehat{\rho}(t/t_w) \tag{54}
$$

holds. If this is the case and if an exponent a<sup>ρ</sup> can be meaningfully extracted, the next problem is relating a<sup>ρ</sup> to a. According to the behavior found in the large N model, the identification a<sup>ρ</sup> = a can be made only if d < d<sup>ρ</sup> and t<sup>w</sup> ≫ t ∗ . Numerical results for TRM in the Glauber-Ising model have been first obtained by HPGL [8]. Plotting ρ(t, tw) against x = t/t<sup>w</sup> for different t<sup>w</sup> in the range t<sup>w</sup> ∈ (25, 250) for d = 2 and t<sup>w</sup> ∈ (15, 100) for d = 3 they have obtained for a<sup>ρ</sup> a result of the form

$$
a_{\rho} = \begin{cases} 1/2 & \text{with log corrections for} \\ 1/2 & \text{for} \end{cases} \quad d = 2
$$
 (55)

and they have made the identification a = aρ.

The next round of simulations has been carried out by us [18] at the same temperatures and for the same system size as HPGL, but extending the range of t<sup>w</sup> up to 2500 for d = 2 and 250 for d = 3. Performing a different data analysis, i.e. plotting ρ(t, tw) versus t<sup>w</sup> for fixed x = t/tw, we have found good agreement between the slope of the curves in the large t<sup>w</sup> region, which in the log-log plot gives the effective exponent (49), and the known values of λ/z for the Ising model (λ/z = 5/8 for d = 2 and λ/z = 3/4 for d = 3). This is good evidence that in the scalar case TRM follows the crossover pattern obtained in the large N model when d < d<sup>ρ</sup> and with a crossover time t ∗ larger than the maximum t<sup>w</sup> that we have reached in the simulations. Furthermore, on the basis of our data, we have estimated that the largest t<sup>w</sup> used by HPGL in Ref. [8] was not enough to enter the scaling regime (i.e. they had always t<sup>w</sup> ≤ tsc) and therefore the values of a<sup>ρ</sup> they have obtained do not warrant any statement neither on the asymptotic value of a<sup>ρ</sup> nor on a. Our longer range of t<sup>w</sup> seems to be barely sufficient to enter the preasymptotic region where aρ,ef f = λ/z, suggesting that both d = 2 and d = 3 are smaller than dρ, whose value in the Ising model, so far, we do not know. Hence, in order to observe the asymptotic exponent one shoud go to much longer waiting times tw.

Henkel and Pleimling [28] have produced new simulations for d = 2 extending the range of t<sup>w</sup> up to 5000. Plotting ρ(t, tw) versus t<sup>w</sup> for fixed x and adhering to the point of view that the TRM data are affected by a long crossover, they claim i) to have succeded in going past the crossover time reaching the asymptotic region and ii) to have found that Eq. (55) is verified. The objection to this claim is that in d = 2 one has λ/z = 5/8 > 1/2 > a<sup>χ</sup> = 1/4. Therefore, even if a decrease of the slope from a number close to λ/z = 0.625 toward 0.5 is observed over a narrow time window, there is no way to decide whether the true asymptotic regime has been reached or the slope might still keep on decreasing, by going further with tw, untill reaching asymptotics at 0.25.

In other words, the new simulations in Ref. [28] leave the issue undecided and yet longer simulations are needed. Despite, by now, there is sufficient evidence that TRM is not the most efficient and reliable way to get to the exponent a, we have undertaken new simulations with t<sup>w</sup> up to 5000 for d = 2 and 500 for d = 3 (for the lattice size and number of realizations see Table III).

TABLE III. Lattice size N and number of realizations in the computation of ρag(t, tw) at different waiting times

The double logarithmic plot of ρ(t, tw) versus t<sup>w</sup> for fixed x shows (Fig. 6) that a power law behavior, possibly, sets in only in the region of the largest t<sup>w</sup> reached. Taking the slope in this region as a measure of aef f,ρ we find values (inset of Fig. 6) which lie above 0.5 for all x and that are just below λ/z = 0.625 for d = 2 and λ/z = 0.75 for d = 3. Hence, although we have reached the same maximum value of t<sup>w</sup> as in Ref. [28] for d = 2 and we have gone much farther for d = 3, we may state that no evidence of asymptotic behavior with a<sup>ρ</sup> = 1/2 is found. Rather, the combination of the d = 2 and d = 3 data in Fig. 6 shows unequivocally that, at best, only the onset of the scaling region is entered where aρ,ef f is about to take the preasymptotic value λ/z, confirming the picture obtained in our previous work [18].

**Caption:** Figure 6 shows the effective exponent aρ,ef f in the large N model versus tw for varying values of r, with x = 20 and d = 2.1. The plot reveals distinct regimes of behavior, indicating the crossover time tsc and the transition from early to late stage dynamics.

FIG. 6. ρag(t, tw) versus t<sup>w</sup> for fixed x = 7. The slopes in the large t<sup>w</sup> region yielding aρ,ef f for different values of x are depicted in the inset.

In summary, we have accumulated sufficient numerical evidence to establish that TRM data fit in the general pattern of behavior abtained from the solution of the large N model, with d<sup>ρ</sup> > 3 and a value of t <sup>∗</sup> which is greater than the largest t<sup>w</sup> reached so far. Therefore, since asymptotics has not been reached, no statement on a can be made from the present knowledge of TRM.

Finally, let us make a comment on the quotation in Ref.s [8,29,30] of the analytical solution of the GAF approximation by Berthier et al. [13] as a support to the claim that a is given by Eq. (55). In fact, here is where is most evident the type of confusion that can be made by not being careful about which exponent one is talking about. In their computation Berthier et al. find a<sup>χ</sup> = 1/2 for d ≥ 2 with logarithmic correction at d = 2, as in Eq. (55)which, however, is meant for a. What one should have clear in mind is that they compute an a<sup>χ</sup> for d ≥ dχ, i.e. right where a<sup>χ</sup> 6= a. This can be checked recalling that in the GAF approximation a is given by Eq. (18) and that d<sup>χ</sup> = 2. Hence, for d = 2 the logarithmic correction belongs to a<sup>χ</sup> and not to a. For d = 3 it is a<sup>χ</sup> that takes the value 1/2, while from Eq. (18) follows a = 1. So, the results of Berthier et al. certainly cannot be quoted if one wants to identify with a an exponent obeying Eq. (55).

### V. TRM AND ZFC IN THE LARGE N MODEL

In this section we study in detail the large N model [16,31] as a useful example which gives the complete picture of what happens when looking at the different response functions introduced above.

Consider a system with vector order parameter φ~(~x) = (φ1(~x), ..., φ<sup>N</sup> (~x)) and Hamiltonian of the Ginzburg-Landau form

$$
\mathcal{H}[\vec{\phi}] = \int d^d x \left[ \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \vec{\phi})^2 + \frac{r}{2} \vec{\phi}^2 + \frac{g}{4N} (\vec{\phi}^2)^2 \right] \tag{56}
$$

where r < 0, g > 0. In the large N limit the equation of motion for the generic component of the order parameter in Fourier space is given by [16]

$$
\frac{\partial \phi(\vec{k},t)}{\partial t} = -[k^2 + I(t)]\phi(\vec{k},t) + \eta(\vec{k},t)
$$
\n(57)

where η( ~k, t) is a gaussian white noise with expectations

$$
\langle \vec{\eta}(\vec{k},t) \rangle = 0
$$
  

$$
\langle \eta(\vec{k},t) \eta(\vec{k}',t') \rangle = 2T(2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{k}+\vec{k}') \delta(t-t')
$$
 (58)

T is the temperature of the quench and the function of time

$$
I(t) = r + g\langle \phi^2(\vec{x}, t) \rangle \tag{59}
$$

must be determined self-consistently, with the average on the right hand side taken both over thermal noise and initial conditions. The formal solution of (57) is given by

$$
\phi(\vec{k},t) = R(\vec{k},t,0)\phi_0(\vec{k}) + \int_0^t ds R(\vec{k},t,s)\eta(\vec{k},s)
$$
\n(60)

where R( ~k, t, s) is the response function

$$
R(\vec{k}, t, s) = \frac{Y(s)}{Y(t)} e^{-k^2(t-s)}
$$
\n(61)

with Y (t) = exp[Q(t)] and Q(t) = R <sup>t</sup> 0 dsI(s). With an uncorrelated initial state at very high temperature the initial condition φ0( ~k) = φ( ~k, t = 0) can be taken to be gaussianly distributed with expectations

$$
\langle \phi_0(\vec{k}) \rangle = 0
$$
  

$$
\langle \phi_0(\vec{k}) \phi_0(\vec{k}') \rangle = \Delta (2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{k} + \vec{k}').
$$
 (62)

The actual solution is obtained once the function Y (t) is determined. In order to do this notice that from the definition of Y (t) follows

$$
\frac{dY^2(t)}{dt} = 2[r + g\langle \phi^2(\vec{x}, t) | Y^2(t). \tag{63}
$$

Writing hφ 2 (~x, t)i in terms of the structure factor

$$
\langle \phi^2(\vec{x}, t) \rangle = \int \frac{d^d k}{(2\pi)^d} C(\vec{k}, t) e^{-k^2/\Lambda^2}
$$
\n(64)

where Λ is the momentum cutoff and using Eq.(60) to evaluate hφ( ~k, t)φ( ~k ′ , t)i = C( ~k, t)(2π) d δ( ~k + ~k ′ ) we obtain

$$
C(\vec{k},t) = R^2(\vec{k},t,0)\Delta + 2T \int_0^t ds R^2(\vec{k},t,s).
$$
\n(65)

Then, inserting Eq. (64) into Eq. (63) we obtain the integro-differential equation

$$
\frac{dY^{2}(t)}{dt} = 2rY^{2}(t) + 2g\Delta f\left(t + \frac{1}{2\Lambda^{2}}\right) + 4gT\int_{0}^{t} ds f\left(t - s + \frac{1}{2\Lambda^{2}}\right) Y^{2}(s)
$$
\n(66)

where f(x) ≡ R d dk (2π) d e −2k <sup>2</sup><sup>x</sup> = (8πx) − <sup>d</sup> <sup>2</sup> . After solving this equation, the response function is given by

$$
R(t,s,t_0) = \int \frac{d^d k}{(2\pi)^d} R(\vec{k},t,s) e^{-k^2/\Lambda^2} = (4\pi)^{-d/2} \frac{Y(s)}{Y(t)} (t-s+t_0)^{-d/2}
$$
(67)

where t<sup>0</sup> = 1/(2Λ<sup>2</sup> ).

Let us now come to the identification of the general structure of Eq. (5). Since in the stationary regime Y (t) is time independent, we immediately obtain

$$
R_{st}(t-s,t_0) = (4\pi)^{-d/2}(t-s+t_0)^{-d/2}
$$
\n(68)

and

$$
R_{ag}(t,s,t_0) = (4\pi)^{-d/2} \left[ \frac{Y(s)}{Y(t)} - 1 \right] (t - s + t_0)^{-d/2}.
$$
 (69)

Notice that Rst(t−s, t0) is temperature independent, implying that there is a stationary response also at T = 0. This holds for soft spins, while for Ising spins there is no stationary response at T = 0.

Next, in order to investigate the scaling properties we must first learn about the time dependence of Y (t). We do this in the T = 0 case, since quenches below the critical point are controlled by the T = 0 fixed point [2]. Making the ansatz Y (t) = At<sup>−</sup><sup>ω</sup> from (66) one gets

$$
A\omega t^{-(2\omega+1)} = rAt^{-2\omega} + \frac{2g\Delta}{(8\pi)^{d/2}}(t+t_0)^{-d/2}
$$
\n(70)

and assuming that the left hand side is negligible one finds ω = d/4 with A = (8π) <sup>−</sup>d/<sup>2</sup>∆/M<sup>2</sup> 0 , where M<sup>0</sup> = p −r/g is the zero temperature magnetization. This is consistent if, in addition to t ≫ t0, one has also

$$
t \gg t_{sc} = -d/(4r) \tag{71}
$$

where the characteristic time tsc sets the time scale over which the three terms in Eq.(70) are all of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, tsc is the characteristic time separating the early from the late stage.

The above described behavior of Y (t) is illustrated in Fig. 7 displaying the numerical solution of Eq. (66) for different values of r. In all numerical computations we will take ∆ = 1, T = 0 and time is measured in units t0. The onset of the scaling behavior is sharp and we have identified tsc with the time where the power law begins (inset of Fig. 7). Then, for s, t > tsc from Eq.s (67) and (69) we have

$$
R(t, s, t_0) = s^{-(1+a)} \tilde{f}(t/s, t_0/s)
$$
\n(72)

with

$$
\widetilde{f}(x,y) = (4\pi)^{-d/2} x^{\omega} (x - 1 + y)^{-(1+a)}
$$
\n(73)

where

$$
a = (d - 2)/2.
$$
 (74)

as in Eq. (16).

The connection between ω and λ/z can be established from the autocorrelation function. Keeping on considering T = 0, from C( ~k, t, s) = R( ~k, t, 0)R( ~k, s, 0)∆ follows

$$
C(t,s,t_0) = \int \frac{d^d k}{(2\pi)^d} C(\vec{k},t,s) e^{-k^2/\Lambda^2}
$$
\n(75)

$$
= (4\pi)^{-d/2} \Delta s^{2\omega - (1+a)} (t/s)^{\omega} [t/s + 1 + t_0/s]^{-(1+a)}.
$$
\n(76)

The requirement limt→∞ C(t, t) = M<sup>2</sup> 0 implies

$$
2\omega = 1 + a \tag{77}
$$

and comparing Eq. (76) with Eq. (5) we find

$$
\omega = \lambda/z. \tag{78}
$$

Hence, in the large N model, λ and a are not independent exponents, since from Eq.s (77) and (78) follows

$$
\lambda = 1 + a. \tag{79}
$$

Nonetheless, for generality we shall keep on using the notation with two different exponents λ and a.

**Caption:** Figure 7 illustrates the function Y(t) for different values of r at T = 0. The onset of scaling behavior is marked, with tsc identified at the transition point. This figure highlights the relationship between the characteristic time and the scaling properties of the response function.

FIG. 7. Y (t) for different values of r and T = 0. tsc is estimated at the onset of the power law behavior and plotted against r in the inset.

Finally, for the aging contribution (69) we may write

$$
R_{ag}(t, s, t_0) = s^{-(1+a)} f(t/s, t_0/s)
$$
\n(80)

with

$$
f(x,y) = (4\pi)^{-d/2} (x^{\omega} - 1)(x - 1 + y)^{-(1+a)}
$$
\n(81)

and writing ω = 1 + a − λ/z Eq. (17) is recovered.

The above result shows that in the large N model it is not only Rag(t, s) to scale, but also the full autoresponse function R(t, s). This, obviously, means that Rst(t − s) obeys scaling, as it can be checked immediately from Eq. (68) and this is a consequence of the fact that the whole low temperature phase is critical.

### A. TRM

We now explore the properties of the IRF in the large N model. Let us begin from TRM. Since the explicit forms (68) and (80) with (81) show that Rst(t − s, t0) decays faster than Rag(t, s, t0) with the time separation t − s, taking t ≫ t<sup>w</sup> and using the definitions (33) and (34) the stationary contribution to TRM can be neglected. Hence, in the following we will ignore the distinction between ρ and ρag. Furthermore, taking t<sup>w</sup> > tsc and dropping the dependence on t<sup>0</sup> we can write

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t_{sc}) = \frac{t^{-\lambda/z}}{(4\pi)^{d/2}A} \left[ \int_0^{t_{sc}} ds Y(s) + \int_{t_{sc}}^{t_w} ds Y(s) \right]
$$
\n(82)

where we have separated the preasymptotic from the asymptotic contribution in the integral. We shall see shortly that the first one plays a crucial role. Introducing the notation B(tsc) = R <sup>t</sup>sc 0 dsY (s) and using Y (s) = As−λ/z−(a+1) in the second integral, we find

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t_{sc}) = t_w^{-\lambda/z} \left[ K_0 + K_1 t_w^{\lambda/z-a} \right] (t/t_w)^{-\lambda/z}
$$
\n(83)

where

$$
K_0 = (4\pi)^{-d/2} \left[ \frac{B(t_{sc})}{A} - \frac{t_{sc}^{\lambda/z - a}}{(\lambda/z - a)} \right]
$$
 (84)

and

$$
K_1 = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^{d/2}(\lambda/z - a)}.\tag{85}
$$

Eq. (83) is the main result from which follows the non trivial dependence of a<sup>ρ</sup> on dimensionality. Notice, that all the dependence on the preasymptotic behavior is collected in K<sup>0</sup> and the very presence of this non vanishing term entails that the asymptotic power governing TRM is either λ/z or a according to the sign of (λ/z − a). Therefore, writing λ/z − a = (d<sup>ρ</sup> − d)/d<sup>ρ</sup> with d<sup>ρ</sup> = 4 we have a crossover for d < dρ, logarithmic corrections for d = d<sup>ρ</sup> and a correction to scaling for d > dρ.

Introducing the characteristic time

$$
t^* = \left(\frac{K_0}{|K_1|}\right)^{\frac{1}{\lambda/z-a}}\tag{86}
$$

Eq. (83) for d 6= d<sup>ρ</sup> can be rewritten as

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*) = t_w^{-\lambda/z} \widetilde{E}(t/t_w, t^*/t_w)
$$
\n(87)

with

$$
\widetilde{E}(x,y) = K_0 \left[ 1 \pm y^{\lambda/z - a} \right] x^{-\lambda/z}
$$
\n(88)

where the + and − signs apply to d < d<sup>ρ</sup> and d > dρ, respectively. In the first case the crossover time t ∗ is given by (Appendix)

$$
t^*/t_{sc} \sim t_{sc}^{d/(4-d)} \tag{89}
$$

showing that t ∗ is a new time scale which can become much larger than tsc. Instead, in the second case from Eq. (86) follows (Appendix)

$$
t^*/t_{sc} < 1\tag{90}
$$

implying tw/t<sup>∗</sup> > 1 for any t<sup>w</sup> > tsc. Finally, for d = d<sup>ρ</sup> from Eq. (83) we have

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*, t_{sc}) = (4\pi)^{-d/2} t_w^{-\lambda/z} \left[ 1 + \frac{\log(t_w/t_{sc})}{\log(t^*/t_{sc})} \right] \log(t^*/t_{sc}) (t/t_w)^{-\lambda/z}
$$
\n(91)

where t ∗ is given by

$$
t^*/t_{sc} = e^{Ct_{sc}} \tag{92}
$$

and C is a constant (Appendix).

Therefore, as anticipated in section IV, the scaling properties of TRM exhibit the following dimensionality dependence

d < d<sup>ρ</sup>

There is a crossover with the effective exponent

$$
a_{\rho,eff} = -\frac{\partial \log \rho(t, t_w, t^*)}{\partial \log t_w}\Big|_{t/t_w}
$$
  
=  $\lambda/z - \left[\frac{(t_w/t^*)^{\lambda/z-a}}{1 + (t_w/t^*)^{\lambda/z-a}}\right] (\lambda/z-a)$  (93)

yielding

$$
a_{\rho,eff} = \begin{cases} \lambda/z & \text{for } t_w \ll t^*\\ a & \text{for } t_w \gg t^*. \end{cases}
$$
 (94)

d = d<sup>ρ</sup>

The crossover involves a logarithmic correction

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*) = \begin{cases} t_w^{-\lambda/z} E(t/t_w) & \text{for} \qquad t_w \ll t^* \\ t_w^{-\lambda/z} \log(t_w/t_{sc}) E(t/t_w) & \text{for} \qquad t_w \gg t^*. \end{cases}
$$
(95)

## d > d<sup>ρ</sup>

There is a pure power law for all t<sup>w</sup> > tsc

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*) = t_w^{-\lambda/z} E(t/t_w)
$$
\n(96)

with

$$
E(x) \sim x^{-\lambda/z}.\tag{97}
$$

In the end, in the large N model the relation between a and the exponent a<sup>ρ</sup> appearing in Eq. (54) is given by

$$
a_{\rho} = \begin{cases} a & \text{for } d < d_{\rho} \\ \lambda/z & \text{with log corrections for } d = d_{\rho} \\ \lambda/z & \text{for } d > d_{\rho} \end{cases}
$$
 (98)

where d<sup>ρ</sup> = 4.

In order to illustrate the behavior of TRM we have solved numerically for ρ(t, tw). In Fig. 8 we have plotted the effective exponent (93) versus t<sup>w</sup> for different values of r (giving rise to different values of tsc), with fixed x = t/t<sup>w</sup> = 20 and for d = 2.1 < dρ. The curves show quite clearly three different regimes: the early regime to the left of the peak followed by the intermediate regime going like t −λ/z <sup>w</sup> , whose size depends on tsc, and eventually by the late stage regime going like t −a <sup>w</sup> . The value tmax of t<sup>w</sup> at the peak can be identified with tsc since it depends on r according to Eq. (71) (see inset of Fig. 8). For completeness we have plotted the same figure for d = 5 > d<sup>ρ</sup> (Fig. 9) which shows the existence only of the early regime followed immediately by the asymptotic regime with the exponent λ/z (without any crossover or intermediate scaling regime) according to Eq. (96).

![](_page_19_Figure_0.jpeg)

**Caption:** Figure 8 presents the effective exponent aρ,ef f in the large N model versus tw for different values of r, with x = 20 and d = 5. The absence of crossover indicates a direct transition to the asymptotic regime, consistent with the theoretical predictions for d > dρ.

FIG. 8. Effective exponent aρ,ef f in the large N model versus t<sup>w</sup> for different values of r with x = 20, d = 2.1 and T = 0. The value of t<sup>w</sup> at the maximum corresponds to tsc as shown in the inset.

**Caption:** Figure 9 shows the effective exponent aρ,ef f in the large N model versus tw for varying r, with x = 20 and d = 5. The data confirm the expected behavior, illustrating the transition from early to asymptotic dynamics without crossover effects.

FIG. 9. Effective exponent aρ,ef f in the large N model versus t<sup>w</sup> for different values of r with x = 20, d = 5 and T = 0.

## B. ZFC

Taking t<sup>w</sup> > tsc and using the definitions (33), (68), (69) we have

$$
\chi_{st}(t - t_w, t_0) = \frac{2t_0^{1-d/2}}{(4\pi)^{d/2}(d-2)} \left\{ 1 - \left[ (t - t_w)/t_0 + 1 \right]^{-a} \right\} \tag{99}
$$

and

$$
\chi_{ag}(t, t_w, t_0) = t_w^{-a} F(t/t_w, t_0/t_w)
$$
\n(100)

with

$$
F(x,y) = (4\pi)^{-d/2} x^{-a} \int_{1/x}^{1} du (u^{\lambda/z - (1+a)} - 1)(1 - u + y/x)^{-(1+a)}.
$$
 (101)

Therefore, in order to establish how χag scales with t<sup>w</sup> it is necessary to know how the scaling function F(x, y) behaves for small y. As already pointed out, this depends on the behavior of the integral at the upper limit of integration, which is convergent (divergent) for a < 1 (a ≥ 1). Hence, from 1 − a = (d<sup>χ</sup> − d)/2 with d<sup>χ</sup> = 4 follows

$$
F(x,y) \sim \begin{cases} x^{-a} & \text{for} \quad d < d_\chi \\ x^{-a} \log(x/y) & \text{for} \quad d = d_\chi \\ y^{1-a}/x & \text{for} \quad d > d_\chi. \end{cases} \tag{102}
$$

Inserting into Eq. (100) and comparing with Eq. (38) we recover Eq.s (40) and (42). Finally, for large x we obtain the analogous of Eq. (44)

$$
\widehat{\chi}(x) \sim \begin{cases}\nx^{-a} & \text{for} \quad d < d_{\chi} \\
x^{-a} \log x & \text{for} \quad d = d_{\chi} \\
x^{-1} & \text{for} \quad d > d_{\chi}.\n\end{cases}
$$
\n(103)

Notice that the separation of the stationary from the aging response function has played a crucial role. Had we used the form (31) of HPGL in Eq. (101) we would have obtained a completely different behavior, with d<sup>χ</sup> = 2 and in place of Eq. (40)

$$
a_{\chi} = \begin{cases} a = d/2 - 1 & \text{for } d < 2 \\ 0 & \text{with log corrections for } d = 2 \\ 0 & \text{for } d > 2. \end{cases}
$$
 (104)

In order to illustrate the difference in the behaviors of TRM and ZFC we have solved numerically for χag(t, tw) and for the corresponding effective exponent aχ,ef f (tw, x) (Fig.s 10,11) with the same values of d and r used for TRM. These Figures show that both above and below d<sup>χ</sup> there is no crossover, but there is only the early regime followed abruptly by the asymptotic power law behavior, as for TRM above d<sup>ρ</sup> (Fig. 9). Furthermore, we have depicted in Fig.s 12,13 the scaling function <sup>χ</sup>b(x), obtained by plotting <sup>t</sup> a<sup>χ</sup> <sup>w</sup> χag(tw, x) versus x for different tw, which obeys the power laws (103) for large x. These are the analogous of Fig.s 3,5.

We can now summarise what we have learned from the large N model about the connection between aρ, a<sup>χ</sup> and a. In this case the explicit solution (74) is available and a is a linearly increasing function of dimensionality vanishing at d<sup>L</sup> = 2. The question is how much of this could have been inferred relying only on the information from TRM or ZFC. The answer is that both a<sup>ρ</sup> and a<sup>χ</sup> coincide with a below certain dimensionalities d<sup>ρ</sup> and dχ. At d = d<sup>ρ</sup> and d = d<sup>χ</sup> there are logarithmic corrections, while above these dimensionalities a<sup>ρ</sup> and a<sup>χ</sup> are different from a and differ one from the other (Fig. 14). Although in the large N model d<sup>ρ</sup> = d<sup>χ</sup> = 4, we have kept distinct notations because dρ, which is the dimensionality where λ/z = a, and d<sup>χ</sup> the dimensionality where a − 1 = 0, need not to coincide in general. In the large N model they do coincide because of Eq. (79). Furthermore, even below d<sup>ρ</sup> and dχ, where a<sup>ρ</sup> = a<sup>χ</sup> = a, there remains a considerable difference between TRM and ZFC in relation to the time scales (t <sup>∗</sup> and tsc) over which these exponents are observable. Comparing Fig.s 8,10 one can see at glance that the difference between these time scales in certain conditions, here set by the value of r, can become huge and if working with TRM it may require an enormous t<sup>w</sup> before reaching the asymptotic regime where a<sup>ρ</sup> and a can be identified.

### VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND OPEN PROBLEMS

In conclusion, we have shown that all existing analytical results and the numerical evidence coming from ZFC in the Ising model are consistent with an exponent a of the form (42). The dimensionality independent behavior (39) predicted by the qualitative argument for a<sup>χ</sup> holds only for d > d<sup>χ</sup> where a<sup>χ</sup> 6= a. This is due to the presence of a dangerous irrelevant variable. Once this is taken into account, analytical and numerical results form a coherent picture and the issue can be considered as settled.

For what concerns Eq. (55), regarded in Ref.s [8,28–30] as the exponent a in the Ising model, we have shown that it does not have any analytical foundation, because Ref. [13] contains a computation of aχ. Furthermore, the numerical evidence, being based on TRM data, is inconclusive since the largest t<sup>w</sup> reached so far are below the crossover time t ∗ . Therefore, t<sup>w</sup> is still far from being well inside the asymptotic region as required for the TRM data to qualify as a challange to those obtained from ZFC. There is no doubt that among all possible IRF that one can employ to study the exponent a, TRM is the most unfavourable and the less reliable one, as abundantly explained in the previous sections.

For what concerns the scaling function f(x, y), our ZFC data are consistent with an f(x, y) in the Ising model of the form (20) with the exponent α = a + 1/2 in place of α = a + 1, appearing in the HPGL theory. We have also shown that with the HPGL theory it is not possible to reproduce the short time behavior of Rag(t, s, t0). Nonetheless, our knowledge of the scaling function f(x, y) is still incomplete, since from ZFC data we cannot determine the exponent β.

After this survey of what can and what cannot be done with ZFC and TRM, it seems clear that in order to study Rag(t, s, t0) the right thing to do would be to use neither of them. Rather, one should use an IRF of the general form (32) with t<sup>1</sup> ≫ tsc to eliminate the crossover affecting TRM and with t<sup>2</sup> < t in order to avoid the dangerous irrelevant variable in ZFC. Namely, assuming the form (20) of f(x, y) and using Eq. (32) one should consider

$$
\mu_{ag}(t, t_2, t_1, t_0) = t^{-a} \int_{t_1/t}^{t_2/t} dz \frac{z^{\beta + \alpha - 1 - a}}{(1 - z + t_0/t)^{\alpha}}.
$$
\n(105)

If t<sup>2</sup> < t and t ≫ t0, the dependence on t<sup>0</sup> can be neglected and the above equation can be used in two ways. Rewriting

$$
\mu_{ag}(t, t_2, t_1) = t^{-a} \int_{x_1}^{x_2} dz \frac{z^{\beta + \alpha - 1 - a}}{(1 - z)^{\alpha}}
$$
\n(106)

and keeping x<sup>1</sup> = t1/t and x<sup>2</sup> = t2/t fixed, the exponent a can be measured. Next, for t ≫ t<sup>2</sup> from Eq. (105) follows

$$
\mu_{ag}(t, t_2, t_1) \sim t^{-a} \int_{t_1/t}^{t_2/t} dz z^{\beta + \alpha - 1 - a} \sim t^{-(\beta + \alpha)} \tag{107}
$$

from which <sup>β</sup> <sup>+</sup> <sup>α</sup> can be measured, while <sup>α</sup> as we have seen can be extracted from <sup>χ</sup>b(x). We plan to pursue the investigation of this IRF in future work.

Finally, the results obtained in this paper open a number of interesting problems in the general theory of phase ordering. We stress that our results are phenomenological. In particular, we do not know why d<sup>L</sup> and d<sup>χ</sup> take the values they take. d<sup>L</sup> seems to coincide with the ordinary lower critical dimensionality, but we do not know whether this is really so, or it is just a coincidence. Even less we can tell about the values taken by the upper dimensionality dχ. It should be noted the failure of the GAF approximation to reproduce the correct dependence of a on d in the scalar case. In short, we have no theory for the observed behavior of the response function in phase ordering kinetics.

### VII. APPENDIX

From the definitions (84), (85) and (86) we have

$$
t^* = \left[\frac{B(t_{sc})|\lambda/z-a|}{A} \pm t_{sc}^{\lambda/z-a}\right]^{1/(\lambda/z-a)}\tag{108}
$$

with the +(−) sign if λ/z − a < (>)0, i.e if d > (<)4. In order to estimate B(tsc) we use the linear approximation

$$
B(t_{sc}) = \int_0^{t_{sc}} e^{rs} = (e^{rt_{sc}} - 1)/r.
$$
 (109)

Then, using A = (8π) <sup>−</sup>d/<sup>2</sup>∆/M<sup>2</sup> <sup>0</sup> and tsc = −d/4r we find

$$
B(t_{sc})/A = Ct_{sc}
$$
\n<sup>(110)</sup>

with

$$
C = 4(8\pi)^{d/2}(1 - e^{-d/4})M_0^2/\Delta d \tag{111}
$$

and inserting into Eq. (108) we get

$$
t^*/t_{sc} = \left[\frac{(4-d)}{4}Ct_{sc}^{d/4} \pm 1\right]^{4/(4-d)}.\tag{112}
$$

For d < 4 the above equation must be taken with the minus sign. This requires tsc > [C(4 − d)/4]<sup>−</sup>4/d or 4|r|/d < [C(4 − d)/4]<sup>4</sup>/d. To lift this restriction on the value of r one must do better than the linear approximation in the estimate of B(tsc). Taking tsc large enough Eq. (89) is obtained.

If d > 4, instead, from Eq. (112) follows t <sup>∗</sup> < tsc justifying Eq. (96).

Finally, for d = 4 from Eq. (83) we get

$$
\rho(t, t_w, t^*, t_{sc}) = t_w^{-\lambda/z} \left[ \frac{B(t_{sc})}{A} + \log(t_w/t_{sc}) \right] (4\pi)^{-d/2} (t/t_w)^{-\lambda/z}
$$
\n(113)

and defining t <sup>∗</sup> by

$$
\log(t^*/t_{sc}) = B(t_{sc})/A \tag{114}
$$

Eq.s (91) and (92) are recovered after using Eq. (110).
