Introduction**\n\nThe discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in highly compressed sulphur hydride by Drozdov *et al* <sup>1</sup> manifested a new era in superconductivity. This research field represents one of the most fascinating scientific and technological exploration in modern condensed matter physics where advanced first principles calculations 2–11 are essential part of the experimental quest for the discovery of new hydrides phases 12–21, and both of these directions drive the development of new experimental techniques to study highly-pressurized materials 22–31 .\n\nFrom 2015 till now, several dozens of high-temperature superconducting polyhydride phases have been discovered and studied <sup>1</sup> , 12–21 , 24,32–40 , 41–43. At the same time, high-pressure studies of the superconductivity in non-hydrides are also progressed recently 44–53, including observation of > 26 in highly-compressed elemental titanium 54,55 and scandium 56,57 , and ≅ 78 in 32<sup>7</sup> 58 .\n\nFirst principles calculations 12–21 , 59–68 are essential tool in the quest for room-temperature superconductivity (which was used <sup>65</sup> to explain experimental result <sup>69</sup> for one of the most difficult to explain hydride case, 3), and primary calculated parameter in these calculations is the transition temperature, . As, the confirmation of the predicted , as the determination of other fundamental ground state parameters, for instance, the upper critical field, 2 (0) 5,24,33,39, the lower critical field, 1 (0) 12,22, the self-field critical current density, (, ) 24,70–72, the London penetration depth, (0) 22,23,73,74, the superconducting energy gap amplitude, Δ(0) 75–77, and gap symmetry 78,79, etc., are the task for experiment and data analysis\n\nAnother complication in understanding of the superconductivity in highly-pressurized materials is the phenomenon of nonadiabaticity, which originates from a fact that Migdal-Eliashberg theory of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity 80,81 is based on primary assumption/postulate that the superconductor obeys the inequality:\n\n$$T\\_{\\theta} \\ll T\\_{F} \\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere, is the Debye temperature, and is the Fermi temperature. In other words, Eq. 1 implies that the superconductor exhibits fast electric charge carriers and slow ions. This assumption simplifies theoretical model of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity, however, Eq. 1 is not satisfied for many unconventional superconductors 82–90 (which was first pointed out by Pietronero and co-workers 91–94) and many highly-compressed superconductors 79,89,95–97 .\n\nWhile theoretical aspects of the non-adiabatic effects can be found elsewhere 11,82,88,91–95 , in practice, the strength of the nonadiabatic effects can be quantified by the ratio 89,90 for which in Ref. <sup>89</sup> three characteristic ranges were proposed:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} \\begin{array}{c} \\frac{T\\_{\\theta}}{T\\_{F}} < 0.025 \\rightarrow adiabatic \\; superconductor; \\\\ 0.025 \\lessapprox \\frac{T\\_{\\theta}}{T\\_{F}} \\lessapprox 0.4 \\rightarrow moderate \\,\\text{stong} \\,\\,nonadiabatic \\; superconductor; \\\\ 0.4 < \\frac{T\\_{\\theta}}{T\\_{F}} \\rightarrow \\,nonadiabatic \\; superconductor. \\end{array} \\end{cases} (2)$$\n\nIt was found in Ref. <sup>89</sup>, and confirmed in Ref. <sup>79</sup>, that superconductors with > 10 (from a dataset of 46 superconductors from all major superconductors families) exhibit the ratio in the range 0.025 ≲ ≲ 0.4. This is interesting and theoretically unexplained empirical observation.\n\nIn this study we further extended empirical database by deriving several fundamental parameters:\n\n(1) the Debye temperature, ;\n\n- (2) the electron-phonon coupling constant, −ℎ;\n- (3) the ground state coherence length, (0);\n- (4) the Fermi temperature ;\n- (5) the nonadiabaticity strength constant, ;\n- (6) and the ratio ;\n\nfor five recently discovered highly-compressed superconductors for which reported raw experimental data are enough to deduce mentioned above parameters, and which represent materials with high or record high in their families:\n\n- (1) elemental titanium, − 54,55;\n- (2) <sup>3</sup> <sup>21</sup>;\n- (3) <sup>8</sup> 98;\n- (4) black phosphorous 99–101;\n- (5) violet phosphorous <sup>53</sup> .\n\nIn the result, we derived the nonadiabaticity strength constant, , for these superconductors and confirmed previously reported empirical observation 79,89 that superconductors with > 10 obey the condition 0.025 ≲ ≲ 0.4.\n\n# **2. Utilized models and data analysis tools**\n\n# *2.1. Debye temperature*\n\nDebye temperature, , is one of fundamental parameters which determines the superconducting transition temperature, , within electron-phonon phenomenology 81,102–106 . This parameter can be deduced as a free-fitting parameter from a fit of temperature dependent resistance, (), to the saturated resistance model within the Bloch-Grüneisen (BG) equation 107–110:\n\n$$R(T) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\pi\\_{\\text{Sat}}} + \\frac{1}{\\pi\\_{\\text{B}\\_0 + A\\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_\\theta}\\right)^5 \\int\\_0^T \\frac{\\pi^5}{\\left(e^X - 1\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-X}\\right)} dx}}}\\tag{3}$$\n\nwhere , 0, and are free fitting parameters.\n\n# *2.2. The electron-phonon coupling constant*\n\nFrom the deduced and measured , which we defined by as strict as possible resistance criterion of () → 0, where is the sample resistance at the onset of the superconducting transition, the electron-phonon coupling constant, −ℎ, can be calculated as the root of advanced McMillan equation 103–106:\n\n$$T\\_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.45}\\right) \\times T\\_\\theta \\times e^{-\\left(\\frac{1.04\\left(1+\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}-\\mu^\\*\\left(1+0.62\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}\\right)} \\times f\\_1 \\times f\\_2^\\* \\tag{4}$$\n\n$$f\\_1 = \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}}{2.46(1+3.8\\mu^\\*)}\\right)^{3/2}\\right)^{1/3} \\tag{5}$$\n\n$$f\\_2^\\* = 1 + (0.0241 - 0.0735 \\times \\mu^\\*) \\times \\lambda\\_{e-ph}^2 \\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere ∗ is the Coulomb pseudopotential parameter, which we assumed to be <sup>∗</sup> = 0.13 (which is typical value utilized in the first principles calculation for many electron-phonon mediated superconductors 54,111).\n\n# *2.3. Ground state coherence length*\n\nTo deduce the ground state coherence length, (0), we fitted the upper critical field datatset, 2 (), to analytical approximant of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model 112,113, which was proposed by Baumgartner *et al* <sup>114</sup>:\n\n$$B\\_{c2} \\{ T \\} = \\frac{1}{0.693} \\times \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{2\\pi \\xi^2(0)} \\times \\left( \\left( 1 - \\frac{r}{r\\_c} \\right) - 0.153 \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{r}{r\\_c} \\right)^2 - 0.152 \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{r}{r\\_c} \\right)^4 \\right) \\tag{7}$$\n\nwhere <sup>0</sup> = ℎ 2 is the superconducting flux quantum, ℎ = 6.626 × 10−34 ⋅ is Planck constant, = 1.602 × 10−19 , and (0) and ≡ ( = 0) are free fitting parameters.\n\n# *2.4. The Fermi temperature*\n\nSimplistic approach to calculate the Fermi temperature, , is to use the expression of free-electron model 115,116:\n\n$$T\\_F = \\frac{\\varepsilon\\_F}{k\\_B} = \\frac{(3\\pi^2 n\\hbar^3)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{2m\\_e \\{1 + \\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\} k\\_B} \\tag{8}$$\n\nwhere = 9.109 × 10−31 is bare electron mass, ℏ = 1.055 × 10−34 ⋅ is reduced Planck constant, = 1.381 × 10−23 <sup>2</sup> ⋅ ⋅ −2 ⋅ −1 is Boltzmann constant, and is the charge carrier density per volume (−3 ). Equation 8 can be used, if the Hall resistance measurements were analysed to estimate the charge carrier density, .\n\nIf Hall resistance measurements were not performed, then to calculate the Fermi temperature, we utilized the equation [58,59]:\n\n$$T\\_F = \\frac{\\pi^2 m\\_e}{8k\\_B} \\times \\left(1 + \\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right) \\times \\xi^2(0) \\times \\left(\\frac{ak\\_B T\\_c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2\\tag{9}$$\n\nwhere = 2Δ(0) ∙ is the gap-to-transition temperature ratio and this is the only unknown parameter in Eq. 6.\n\n# *2.5. The gap-to-transition temperature ratio*\n\nTo calculate the Fermi temperature by Eq. 9 there is a need to know = 2Δ(0) ∙ . In this study, to determine = 2Δ(0) ∙ we utilized the following approach. Carbotte <sup>111</sup> collected various parameters for 32 electron-phonon mediated superconductors, which exhibit 0.43 ≤ −ℎ ≤ 3.0 and 3.53 ≤ 2Δ(0) ∙ ≤ 5.19. In Figure 1 we presented the dataset reported by\n\nCarbotte in his Table IV <sup>111</sup>. The dependence 2Δ(0) ∙ vs −ℎ can be approximate by linear\n\nfunction (Fig. 1) <sup>117</sup>:\n\n$$\\frac{\\chi\\_{\\Delta \\{0\\}}}{k\\_B T\\_c} = \\mathcal{C} + D \\times \\lambda\\_{e-ph} \\tag{10}$$\n\nwhere = 3.26 ± 0.06, and = 0.74 ± 0.04.\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1.** The gap-to-transition temperature ratio, 2⋅Δ(0) ⋅ , vs the electron-phonon coupling constant, −ℎ, dataset reported by Carbotte in the Table IV of Ref. <sup>111</sup>. Linear fit is shown by pink line. Positions for some representative superconductors and superconductors studied in this report (where **bP** stands for black phosphorus and **vP** stands for violet phosphorus) are shown. 95% confidence bands for the linear fit are shown by pink shadow area.\n\nAs far as one can determine −ℎ by utilized Equations (3)-(6), the 2Δ(0) ∙ ratio can be\n\nestimated from the Eq.

In Figure 2 we showed the fit of the () dataset measured by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> for the − phase compressed at = 18 to Equation 3.\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Temperature dependent resistance data, *R*(*T*), for compressed titanium ( − -phase at *P* = 18 GPa) and data fit to Eq. 3 (raw data reported by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup>). Green balls indicate the bounds for which *R*(*T*) data was used for the fit to Eq. 3. (a) Fit to Debye model: = 5 (), = 361 ± 1 , ,0.25 = 2.1 , −ℎ = 0.49, fit quality is 0.99988. (b) Fit to Eq. 3: = 3.15 ± 0.03, = 421 ± 2 , ,0.25 = 2.1 , fit quality is 0.99995. 95% confidence bands are shown.\n\nDeduced Debye temperature (Figure 2,a) for − -phase ( = 18 ) is = 361 ± 1 which is in ballpark value with (298 ) = 380 for uncompressed pure elemental titanium, which exhibits − phase <sup>118</sup> .\n\nTo calculate the electron-phonon coupling strength constant, −ℎ, by Equations 4-6, we defined the superconducting transition temperature, <sup>=</sup> 2.1 , by the use of () = 0.25 criterion, which was chosen based on the lowest temperature, at which experimental () data measured at = 18 was reported by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup>. Deduced −ℎ = 0.49, which is very close to the −ℎ = 0.43 of pure elemental aluminium (Fig. 1, and Ref. <sup>111</sup>). \n\nWe also confirmed the power-law exponent = 3.1 (reported by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup>) for the temperature dependent (), which was extracted by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> from the simple powerlaw fit of () at temperature range of 3 ≤ ≤ 70 :\n\n$$R(T) = R\\_0 + \\mathcal{C} \\times T^n \\tag{1l}$$\n\nwhere 0, and are free fitting parameters. As we showed earlier <sup>119</sup>, Eq. 10 does not always return correct -values, and () data fit to Eq. 3, where is free-fitting parameter, is the reliable approach to derive the power-law exponent. However, for the given case, our fit to Eq. 3 (Figure, 2,b) returns the same power-law exponent, = 3.15 ± 0.03, to the one reported by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> .\n\nIn Figure 3 we showed () data measured by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> and Liu *et al* <sup>55</sup> and data fits to Equations 3-7 for the − phase compressed at = 154 (Figure 3,a), = 180 (Figure 3,b), = 183 (Figure 3,c), and = 245 (Figure 3,d).\n\nWhile Liu *et al* <sup>55</sup> reported first principles calculation result for −ℎ and logarithmic frequency for highly compressed titanium over wide range of applied pressure, in Figure 4 we presented a comparison of the deduced −ℎ and values from experiment and calculated ones <sup>55</sup> . To compare (calculated by first principles calculations) and deduced from experiment, we used theoretical expression proposed by Semenok <sup>120</sup>:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{0.827}} \\times \\frac{\\hbar}{k\\_B} \\times \\omega\\_{\\log} \\cong T\\_{\\theta} \\tag{12}$$\n\nIn Figure 4,c we also show values calculated by Eq. 8, where we used derived −ℎ and bulk density of charge carriers in compressed titanium, , measured by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> . Due to Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> reported the () and measured at different pressures, for calculations we assumed the following approximations: ( = 18 ) = ( = 31 ) = 1.72 × 10<sup>28</sup> −3 ; ( = 154 ) = 2.39 × 10<sup>28</sup> −3 ; ( = 180 ) = ( = 183 ) = ( = 177 ) = 1.70 × 10<sup>28</sup> −3 .\n![](0__page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3.** Temperature dependent resistance data, *R*(*T*), for compressed titanium ( − -phase) and data fit to the Debye model (Eq. 3, = 5 ()). Raw data reported by Zhang *et al* <sup>54</sup> (Panels a,b,d) and Liu *et al* <sup>55</sup> (Panel c). Green balls indicate the bounds for which *R*(*T*) data was used for the fit to Eq. 3. Deduced parameters are (a) = 337 ± 1 , ,0.02 = 22.1 , −ℎ = 1.14, fit quality is 0.99992. (b) = 347 ± 2 , ,0.02 = 21.4 , −ℎ = 1.10, fit quality is 0.9998.

Highly-compressed I-43d-phase of TaH<sup>3</sup>*\n\nRecently, He *et al* <sup>21</sup> reported on the observation of high-temperature superconductivity in highly-compressed *I-43d*-phase of TaH3. In Figure 8 we showed the fit of the () dataset measured by He *et al* <sup>21</sup> for the tantalum hydride compressed at = 197 .\n\nBy utilizing Eqs. 4-6, we deduced −ℎ = 1.53 (Fig. 8), which is within ballpark value for other highly compressed hydride superconductors 3,106 .\n\nBecause He *et al* <sup>21</sup> did not report result of Hall coefficient measurements, we deduced the Fermi temperature by the use of Eq. 9, and this we deduced 2 () dataset from *R*(*T*,*B*) curves reported by He *et al* <sup>21</sup> in their Figure 2,a <sup>21</sup>, for which we utilized the criterion of () = 0.02.

For the 2 () definition we utilized the same strict criterion of () =\n\n0.01 for both (, ) datasets in Figure 11.\n\n![](0__page_16_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 11.** Analysis of experimental 2 () datasets for black phosphorus compressed at (a) *P* = 15 GPa reported by Li *et al* <sup>99</sup>, and (b) *P* = 15.9 GPa reported by Guo *et al* <sup>100</sup>. Deduced parameters are: (a) (0) = 67 ± 1 , = 5.5 ± 0.1 , fit quality is 0.9965; (b) (a) (0) = 86 ± 1 , = 5.5 ± 0.1 , fit quality is 0.9981. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow areas in both panels. \n\nAverage deduced parameters for black phosphorus = 15 , which we derived from experimental data analysis reported by three different groups and which were used to position the black phosphorus in Figures 1,5-7 are:\n\n(1) the Debye temperature, = 587 ;\n\n- (2) the electron-phonon coupling constant, −ℎ = 0.548;\n- (3) the ground state coherence length, (0) = 77 ;\n- (4) the Fermi temperature, = 5200 ;\n\n(5) = 0.001, which implies that black phosphorus falls in conventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot;\n\n(6) the nonadiabaticity strength constant, = 0.11.\n\nDeduced parameters show that the black phosphorus compressed at = 15 exhibits low strength of nonadiabatic effects.\n\n## *3.5. Highly-compressed violet phosphorous*\n\nRecently, Wu *et al* <sup>53</sup> reported on the observation of the superconducting state in violet phosphorus (vP) with > 5 when the material is subjected to high pressure in the range of 3.6 ≤ ≤ 40.2 . In Figure 12(a) we showed the () dataset, and data fit to Eq. 3, measured by Wu *et al* <sup>53</sup> in the violet phosphorus compressed at = 40.2 .\n\n2 () dataset was extracted from the only *R*(*T*,*B*) dataset reported by Wu *et al* <sup>53</sup> for material compressed at Wu *et al* <sup>53</sup>. For 2 () definition we utilized the criterion of () = 0.14. Deduced 2 () dataset is shown in Figure 12(b). The fit to Equation 7 (which is single band model) has low quality, because 2 () has an upturn at ≲ 4 . We interpreted this upturn as an evidence for the second band opening at ≲ 4 , and, thus, we fitted data used two-band model 128,135:\n$$B\\_{c2,total}(T) = B\\_{c2,band1}(T) + B\\_{c2,band2}(T) \\tag{13}$$\n\nwhere 2,1 () and 2,2 () exhibit their independent transition temperature and the coherence length. Deduced values are listed in the Figure Caption to Figure 12. However for further analysis we used = ,1 = 9.0 and (0) = 36 ± 1 .\n\n![](1__page_18_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 12.** Analysis of experimental data for violet phosphorus compressed at (a) = 40.2 and (b) = 34.8 . Raw data reported Wu *et al* <sup>53</sup> . (a) Temperature dependent resistance data, *R*(*T*), and data fit to Eq. 3. Green balls indicate the bounds for which *R*(*T*) data was used for the fit to Eq. 3. Deduced = 655 ± 4 , ,0.01 = 9.4 , −ℎ = 0.607, fit quality is 0.9991. (b) The upper critical field data, *B*c2(*T*), and data fit to Eq. 13. Definition *B*c2(*T*) criterion of () = 0.14 was used. Deduced parameters are: (0)1 = 50 ± 1 , ,1 = 9.0 ± 0.2 , (0)1 = 53 ± 2 , ,2 = 4.0 ± 0.1 . Fit quality is 0.9977. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow areas in both panels.\n\nProcessing data by the same approach described in previous Sections, we derived the\n\nfollowing parameters for violet phosphorus compressed at ~40 :\n\n- (1) the Debye temperature, = 665 ± 4 ;\n- (2) the electron-phonon coupling constant, −ℎ = 0.607;\n- (3) the ground state coherence length, (0) = 36 ± 1 ;\n- (4) the Fermi temperature, = 3240 ;\n\n(5) = 0.003, which implies that this phase falls in close proximity to conventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot;\n\n(6) the nonadiabaticity strength constant, = 0.21. Derived parameters imply that the violet phosphorus (compressed at ~40 ) exhibits moderate level of nonadiabatic effects similar to the ones in highly-compressed hydrogenrich near-room temperature superconductors 3 and 10.\n\n## **4. Discussion**\n\nAs it was mentioned above superconductors can be classified by the ratio of maximum phonon energy, ℏ (where is Debye frequency) to the charge carrier energy at the Fermi level, ℏ . For practical use, it is more convenient to replace ℏ term by , where is the Debye temperature, which can be deduced from experimental measurements.\n\nThus, in so-called adiabatic regime, ℏ = ≲ 10−3 , superconductors exhibit very fast charge carriers and relatively slow phonons. This condition is satisfied for pure metals and some superconducting alloys (Figures 5-7).\n\nHowever, as it can be seen in Figures 6,7, more than ¾ of superconductors (including important for practical use Nb3Sn, MgB2, pnictides, cuprates and record high-*T*<sup>c</sup> near-room temperature superconducting hydrides) have the ratio in a different range 79,89:\n\n$$0.025 \\le \\frac{\\hbar \\omega\\_{\\rm D}}{k\\_B T\\_F} \\le 0.4 \\tag{14}$$\n\nOur experimental data search 79,89 revealed that only six superconductors exhibit (Figures 6,6):\n\n$$\\frac{\\mu\\_{\\text{A}\\_{B}}}{\\mu\\_{\\text{B}}T\\_{F}} > 0.4 \\tag{15}$$\n\nThese materials are 79,89: Nb0.75Mo0.25B2, Nb0.5Os0.5, highly compressed metalized oxygen, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, SrTiO3, and highly compressed metalized ionic salt CsI. It should be stressed that all these superconductors exhibit low transition temperature, < 8 .\n\nIn this regard, studied in this report five recently discovered superconductors (Sections 3.1-3.5) confirmed the validity of Equation 14. And, thus, perhaps a deep physical origin related to the strength of the nonadiabaticity ℏ = within a range indicated in Equation 14 can be revealed.\n\n## **4. Conclusions**\n\nIn this work, we analysed experimental data reported for five recently discovered highlycompressed superconductors: − 54,55 , <sup>3</sup> 21 , <sup>8</sup> <sup>98</sup>, black phosphorous 99–101, and violet phosphorous <sup>53</sup>, for which we established several superconducting parameters,\n\nincluding the strength of nonadiabaticity, ℏ = .\n\n**Funding:** This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, grant number No. 122021000032-5 (theme \"Pressure\").

(Nature 2015, 525, 73) discovered a superconducting state with Tc=203 K in highly compressed sulfur hydride. To date, several dozen high-temperature superconducting polyhydrides have been discovered and, in addition, it was recently reported that highly compressed titanium and scandium exhibit record-high Tc (up to 36 K). This exceeded the Tc=9.2 K value of niobium many times over, which was the record-high Tc ambient pressure metallic superconductor. Here, we analyzed the experimental data for the recently discovered high-pressure superconductors (which exhibit high transition temperatures within their classes): elemental titanium (Zhang et al., Nature Communications 2022; Liu et al., Phys. Rev. B 2022), TaH3 (He et al., Chinese Phys. Lett. 2023), LaBeH8 (Song et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023), black phosphorous (Li et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2018; Jin et al., arXiv 2023), and violet (Wu et al., arXiv 2023) phosphorous to reveal the nonadiabaticity strength constant TθTF (where Tθ is the Debye temperature, and TF the Fermi temperature) in these superconductors. The analysis showed that the δ-phase of titanium and black phosphorous exhibits TθTF scores that are nearly identical to those associated with A15 superconductors, while the studied hydrides and violet phosphorous exhibit constants in the same ballpark as those of H3S and LaH10.",
