Nb3Sn and V3Si thin films are promising candidates as thin films for the next generation of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities. However, sputtered films often suffer from stoichiometry and strain issues during deposition and post annealing. In this study, we explore the structural and chemical effects of thermal annealing, both in-situ and post-sputtering, on DC-sputtered Nb3Sn and V3Si films of varying thickness on Nb or Cu substrates, extending from our initial studies [\\[1\\]](#page-12-0). Through annealing at 950 °C, we successfully enabled recrystallization of 100 nm thin Nb3Sn films on Nb substrate with stoichiometric and strain-free grains. For 2 µm thick films, we observed the removal of strain and a slight increase in grain size with increasing temperature. Annealing enabled a phase transformation from unstable to stable structure on V3Si films, while we observed significant Sn loss in 2 µm thick Nb3Sn films after high temperature anneals. We observed similar Sn and Si loss on films atop Cu substrates during annealing, likely due to Cu-Sn and Cu-Si phase generation and subsequent Sn and Si evaporation. These results encourage us to refine our process to obtain high-quality sputtered films for SRF use.\n\nKeywords: thermal annealing, A15 superconductors, sputtering, thin film, SRF Submitted to: Superconductor Science and Technology\n\n#### 1. Introduction\n\nNb3Sn and V3Si thin films are of increasing interest to the superconducting radiofrequency community owing to the quest of achieving high accelerating gradient and efficiency. As niobium-based superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are reaching the theoretical limits [\\[2\\]](#page-12-1), alternative materials are of great interest to continue the quest of increasing quality factors, accelerating gradients, and efficiency [\\[3\\]](#page-12-2). A15 superconductors Nb3Sn and V3Si are promising candidates for this role, used as thin films inside either Nb or Cu cavities [\\[3,](#page-12-2) [4\\]](#page-12-3). Both candidates have relatively high critical temperatures (Tc,Nb3Sn = 18.3 K and Tc,V3Si = 17.1 K), and Nb3Sn is predicted to yield a superheating field of ∼ 440 mT that doubles the Nb limit of ∼ 240 mT [\\[3,](#page-12-2) [5,](#page-12-4) [6,](#page-12-5) [7,](#page-12-6) [8\\]](#page-12-7). These properties could allow cavity operation at an elevated temperature of ∼ 4 K and the potential for increased accelerating gradients [\\[9\\]](#page-12-8). This higher operating temperature allows for reduced cryogenic costs and simpler infrastructure for particle accelerators and their applications [\\[3\\]](#page-12-2). Due to their brittle nature and low thermal conductivity, Nb3Sn and V3Si are best suited for use as a thin film inside a host cavity with better thermal conductivity, such as Nb or Cu [\\[3,](#page-12-2) [10,](#page-12-9) [11\\]](#page-12-10).\n\nNb3Sn thin films have been achieved through vapor diffusion, sputtering, electroplating, and chemical vapor deposition [\\[12,](#page-12-11) [13,](#page-12-12) [14,](#page-12-13) [15,](#page-12-14) [16,](#page-13-0) [17\\]](#page-13-1). In the state-of-the-art vapor diffusion, a niobium cavity is placed in a hightemperature vacuum furnace, and then tin or tin chloride sources are vaporized and allowed to diffuse into the niobium surface for alloying [\\[3,](#page-12-2) [9,](#page-12-8) [13,](#page-12-12) [18,](#page-13-2) [19,](#page-13-3) [20\\]](#page-13-4). In contrast, sputtering utilizes high-energy plasma to directly eject target materials onto a substrate at low temperatures [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [6,](#page-12-5) [12,](#page-12-11) [21,](#page-13-5) [22\\]](#page-13-6). Alternatively, Nb3Sn films are fabricated via electroplating in aqueous solutions working at near-room temperatures and atmospheric pressure followed by heat treatment [\\[14,](#page-12-13) [15,](#page-12-14) [16,](#page-13-0) [23\\]](#page-13-7), or via chemical vapor deposition that takes advantage of reactions between volatile precursors [\\[24\\]](#page-13-8). Nb3Sn has been successfully vapor-diffused inside cavities, where a single-cell reached gradients of 24 MV/m, while Nb3Sn 9- and 5-cells reached 15 MV/m, both with Q0's on the order of 10<sup>10</sup> at operating temperature 4.4 K [\\[19,](#page-13-3) [20\\]](#page-13-4). In cavity tests, maximum surface fields of 120 mT (pulsed operation) and 80 – 100 mT (CW) have been achieved, showing that Nb3Sn cavities can be operated reliably in a flux-free metastable state above the lower critical field of this material (around 40 mT) [\\[7,](#page-12-6) [25\\]](#page-13-9).\n\nIn the sputtering process, the film properties are tailored by controlling the Ar/Kr plasma pressure, substrate temperature, sputtering voltage, sputtering current, rate of deposition, and post-sputtering anneal temperature/duration. In literature [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [6,](#page-12-5) [9,](#page-12-8) [12,](#page-12-11) [26\\]](#page-13-10), sputtered Nb3Sn films have been demonstrated on Nb and Cu surfaces by using a stoichiometric Nb3Sn target, by co-sputtering with Nb and Sn targets, or through annealing a sputtered Nb/Sn multilayer. A stoichiometric target allows for a design where only a single target is used [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [6,](#page-12-5) [26,](#page-13-10) [27\\]](#page-13-11). Co-sputtering involves the use of separate Nb and Sn targets that are sputtering at the same time, allowing for tuning of the power applied to each target [\\[21,](#page-13-5) [28\\]](#page-13-12). Multilayer sputtering also uses separate Nb and Sn targets but alternates the use of each target to create many ultrathin layers of each material [\\[11,](#page-12-10) [12,](#page-12-11) [22\\]](#page-13-6). Tc's above 17.8 K have been observed for single-target and multilayer sputtering [\\[6,](#page-12-5) [11,](#page-12-10) [12\\]](#page-12-11).\n\nV3Si films have been attempted by thermal diffusion, magnetron sputtering, and highpower impulse magnetron sputtering (HiP- IMS) [\\[10,](#page-12-9) [11,](#page-12-10) [27,](#page-13-11) [28\\]](#page-13-12). In thermal diffusion, a vanadium layer on a silicon-on-insulator substrate is annealed at high temperature to produce V3Si [\\[28\\]](#page-13-12). In the HiPIMS method, power is applied as a set of discrete high-energy pulses at a low-duty cycle, which can be used to ion bombard the substrate, recrystallizing films at a low temperature and allowing more control of the stoichiometry; this method of depositing V3Si films on Cu substrates produced T<sup>c</sup> up to 10 K [\\[10\\]](#page-12-9). CERN's magnetron sputtered V3Si films on a silver buffer layer upon a Cu substrate have reached T<sup>c</sup> of 11.2K [\\[27\\]](#page-13-11).\n\nThermal annealing of the sputtered films, either in situ or post-deposition, is required to minimize the internal stress induced by the sputtering process and improve the stoichiometry and grain structures, which are important for their critical temperature and cavity RF performance [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [6,](#page-12-5) [12\\]](#page-12-11). However, during annealing of sputtered Nb3Sn or Nb/Sn multilayers, the films suffer from issues such as Sn loss, Cu incorporation into the film from Cu substrates, high strain, and interface issues at the substrate-film boundary [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [6,](#page-12-5) [12\\]](#page-12-11). Sn loss is a critical issue because of the dependence of T<sup>c</sup> on Sn concentration [\\[3\\]](#page-12-2). While annealing is frequently performed on Nb3Sn films, these high temperatures have led to Sn loss in the furnace and Nb-rich films with reduced T<sup>c</sup> [\\[6,](#page-12-5) [12\\]](#page-12-11), which motivates us to mechanistically understand the phase transformation associated with annealing. Cu incorporation can occur during annealing, which lowers the T<sup>c</sup> [\\[4\\]](#page-12-3). This issue can be addressed by using a barrier layer such as tantalum to reduce the interdiffusion [\\[27\\]](#page-13-11). The interface between Nb3Sn and Cu also suffers from strain because of their different thermal expansion coefficients and lattice mismatch, which can cause cracking in the film [\\[4\\]](#page-12-3). Cracking can release high initial strain in the lattice, but does not relieve microstrain and increases surface roughness while decreasing the uniformity of the film [\\[4,](#page-12-3) [29\\]](#page-13-13). Currently, no sputtered Nb3Sn cavity test has been reported. Moreover, V3Si is much less studied than Nb3Sn, and there has been no RF test to date [\\[10,](#page-12-9) [11,](#page-12-10) [27\\]](#page-13-11).\n\nOne goal of this work is to optimize the sputtering capability of these alternative SRF materials at Cornell and compare our results with existing efforts in the SRF field. Most importantly, we aim to systematically investigate the effect of thermal annealing on the sputtered Nb3Sn and V3Si thin films in order to better understand these observed issues and design an optimal process for SRF use. By understanding the impacts of deposition and annealing parameters, our goal is to find the root of the issues in stoichiometry and strain of thin films. With such knowledge, we hope to provide insights for the development of sputtered Nb3Sn and V3Si cavities. In this study, we investigate Nb3Sn and V3Si films of different thicknesses on both Nb and Cu substrates to optimize the best conditions that minimize strain while producing required stoichiometry and superconducting properties.\n\n## 2. Methods\n\nNb3Sn and V3Si thin films were deposited using a DC-sputtering system at the Cornell Center for Materials Research. A high vacuum of 10<sup>−</sup><sup>6</sup> torr base pressure was achieved using a cryo-pumped system. All depositions were performed at 5 mTorr Ar pressure. A rotating stage was used, when possible, to ensure uniformity during deposition.\n\nAs summarized in Table [1,](#page-3-0) the sputtering parameters varied were the film material (Nb3Sn vs. V3Si), substrate material (Nb\n\n| Film  |    | Substrate Substrate<br>holder | Temperature<br>(°C) | Voltage<br>(V) | Current<br>(A) | Nominal<br>thickness |\n|-------|----|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Nb3Sn | Nb | Rotating                      | 25                  | 596            | 0.15           | 100 nm               |\n| Nb3Sn | Nb | Rotating                      | ><br>25             | 589            | 0.26           | 2<br>µm              |\n| Nb3Sn | Cu | Heated                        | 550                 | 466            | 0.214          | 300 nm               |\n| V3Si  | Nb | Rotating                      | ><br>25             | 811            | 0.196          | 2<br>µm              |\n| V3Si  | Cu | Heated                        | 550                 | 819            | 0.222          | 300 nm               |\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>Table 1.

Bulk Nb3Sn and V3Si targets were used, and they were purchased from ACI alloy, Inc. The impurity concentrations as received were 0.01 at.%.\n\nNb and Cu squared substrates of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> area were used in order to provide insights for applications in Nb and Cu substrate cavities. Before deposition, Nb substrates were electropolished, and Cu substrates were chemically polished to ensure a smooth surface.\n\nThe Nb3Sn and V3Si films were designed to have thicknesses of 100 nm and 2 µm on Nb substrates and 300 nm on Cu substrates. The deposition rate was 2.5 ˚A/s for all samples except for the V3Si film on Cu substrate which was 1.8 ˚A/s (as there was difficulty lighting the plasma). The deposition temperature for the thick 2 µm samples is subject to error because the temperature is uncontrolled upon the rotating stage and increased through the 133-minute deposition. Subsequently, a 550 ℃ heating stage was applied to investigate the effect of in situ heating during deposition.\n\nAfter the sputtering process, films were annealed in a series of elevated temperatures at 600 ℃, 700 ℃, 800 ℃, and 950 ℃, each for 6 hours, in a Lindberg high-vacuum (3 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>7</sup> Torr) furnace. The heating rate was 10 ℃ per minute, and the annealing was followed by furnace cooling.\n\nStructural and chemical analyses were conducted between anneals to characterize the films. These analysis methods included scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the grain structure and size, energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies to determine the atomic composition, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to gain insight into the crystal structure of the film and calculate the strain. In this analysis, the key features are the quality of the film surfaces (smoothness, uniformity, grain shape/size), the stoichiometry of the films, and the existence and strain of Nb3Sn and V3Si diffraction planes. Note that EDS results were calibrated with regard to the electron penetration depth in each material and the film thickness.\n\nFinally, on the 100 nm thin Nb3Sn film that yields the best performance, we verified its critical temperature using a quantum design physical property measurement system (PPMS) and quantified the surface roughness using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n\n#### 3. Results and Discussion\n\nIn this section, we first analyze the recrystallization behavior observed in the 100 nm thin Nb3Sn films annealed and discuss the superconducting, composition, and surface properties of these films. Next, we show the composition and strain evolutions as a function of annealing temperature in the 2 µm thick Nb3Sn and V3Si films (on Nb) and attempt to understand the Sn loss and strain relief mechanisms. Finally, we show the ternary phase transformation upon annealing in the 300 nm thick Nb3Sn and V3Si films that were deposited on Cu substrates. Representative surface morphologies of samples upon deposition and after 700 °C and 950 °C anneals are shown in figure S1.\n\n### 3.1. Thin Nb3Sn film: Recrystallization\n\n3.1.1. Recrystallization behavior Figure [1](#page-4-0) shows the evolution of surface morphology with increasing temperature for the 100 nm thin Nb3Sn film on Nb substrate. We observed evident grain recrystallization at 950 ℃ anneals. The grain size increased from a few nanometers as deposited (figure [1a](#page-4-0)) to approximately 300 nm after annealing (figure [1d](#page-4-0)). Recrystallization occurs through the release of strain energy during annealing and the subsequent migration of grain boundaries [\\[30\\]](#page-13-14).\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>Here, we discuss the driving force and boundary mobility for thermodynamic considerations of this recrystallization annealing. The stored energy per unit volume (Es) at a strain level () of 0.2, the maximum strain measured from our sputtered films, is 2.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> J/m<sup>3</sup> , based on a 1-dimensional elastic assumption, E<sup>s</sup> = 1/2 E 2 , where E is Young's modulus and the value for Nb3Sn at 300 K is 13.7 × 10<sup>11</sup> dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> [\\[31\\]](#page-13-15). Indeed, this value\n\n![](_page_4_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nis dramatically larger than the typical lightly- Figure 1.

Observed Nb3Sn diffraction planes are labeled at the top.\n\ndeformed energy of 10<sup>5</sup> J/m<sup>3</sup> for driving recrystallization in metals [\\[32\\]](#page-13-16). This suggests a sufficient driving force from the sputtering-induced strain within the film to enable the recrystallization annealing.\n\nOur X-ray diffraction data (figure [2\\)](#page-5-0) shows the Nb3Sn phase is consistent in terms of grain orientation at all annealing temperatures including 950 ℃ recrystallizations. We find Nb3Sn peaks near the known powder diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6°, 37.7°, 41.5°, 62.8°, 65.6°, 70.6°, and 82.9°[\\[34\\]](#page-13-17). Due to the large penetration depth of the X-ray probe, strong Nb substrate diffractions are seen at 2θ = 38.4°, 53.3°, and 69.3°. A complete list of known peak locations is shown in table S1. As the annealing temperature was increased to 950 ℃, the grain orientations of Nb3Sn remained while the growth of grain size was significant.\n\nWe assume this recrystallization follows a boundary migration mechanism and evaluate the boundary mobility by the Arrhenius law, d = A × exp (- E<sup>a</sup> / RT), where d is the equilibrium grain size, A is the pre-exponential factor, E<sup>a</sup> is the activation energy, and T is annealing temperature. The apparent values of the pre-exponential factor and activation energy were determined to be 2.59 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 63 ± 2 kJ/mol, respectively, by Schelb [\\[33\\]](#page-13-18). At an annealing temperature of 950 ℃, the maximum attainable grain size is in the range of 434 – 643 nm. The observed ∼ 300 nm grain size in our work is reasonable considering the influence from annealing time (6 h in our work versus up to 200 h in Schelb's work).\n\nIn summary, recrystallization anneal above 800 ℃ is effective in relieving the built-in strain from sputtering and thus forming stoichiometric Nb3Sn along with grain coarsening.\n\n3.1.2. Film properties Superconducting properties, atomic composition, and surface roughness were investigated on the 100 nm Nb3Sn sample after the 950 ℃ annealing for 6 hours. As shown in figure [3,](#page-6-0) the critical temperature is determined to be 17.5 K, while the Nb/Sn stoichiometry is 3/1 after sputtering away the surface oxides. Similarly, Sayeed et al. [\\[6\\]](#page-12-5) reported T<sup>c</sup> values of 17.68 – 17.83 K for 350 nm Nb3Sn sputtered films that were annealed at 800 ℃ for 24 hours and 1000 ℃ for 1 hour with low Sn loss. They observed significant degradation of T<sup>c</sup> down to 10.95 K as a consequence of the dramatic Sn loss down to 4% after annealing for 24 h at 1000 ℃. In contrast, we did not observe the Sn loss in the 100 nm thin films after annealing. We infer recrystallization plays a major role in retaining the Sn ratio as well as maintaining T<sup>c</sup> ∼ 17.5 K in the 100 nm thin films, with the relatively short annealing time helping to retain the film properties. However, our 2 µm thick films as detailed in Section 3.2 showed similar Sn loss behavior at increasing annealing temperatures as compared to the 350 nm thick films in Sayeed's work [\\[6\\]](#page-12-5), which indicates the importance of a recrystallization process to obtain stoichiometric Nb3Sn films with T<sup>c</sup> 17.5 K. Additionally, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) result is\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Figure 3. Film properties for the 100 nm thin Nb3Sn film on a Nb substrate after 950 ℃ annealing.

The film shows low surface roughness, with an average roughness of 18.3 nm, RMS roughness of 25.3 nm, and a maximum height difference of 600 nm. In contrast, Nb substrates used have an average roughness of ∼ 70 nm.\n\n# 3.2. Thick Nb3Sn and V3Si films: relation of strain and composition change\n\nThermal annealing was performed on 2 µm thick Nb3Sn and V3Si films on the Nb substrate. The initial thickness of the films greatly altered the annealing behaviors as compared to results from 100 nm thin films.\n\n3.2.1. 2 µm thick Nb3Sn films The Nb3Sn grains nucleated in a triangular shape and remained in that shape at all annealing temperatures studied (figure [4a](#page-7-0) and [4b](#page-7-0)). We speculate that these small triangular-shaped grains with 100 – 200 nm in size were induced by the high built-in stress and subsequent plastic deformation during deposition. Inplane stress is typical in physical vapor sputtering, and small grains with angular shapes are favored under the stress [\\[35\\]](#page-13-19). This argument is supported by the in situ stress versus grain size relationship in Leib's work [\\[36\\]](#page-13-20).\n\nUpon annealing, as shown in figure [5a](#page-8-0), the 2 µm thick Nb3Sn films experienced significant Sn loss from the as-deposited ∼ 24% down to 21% after the initial anneal at 600 ℃ and further down to nearly 2% after the 950 ℃ anneal. Conversely, Nb3Sn phases were barely observed in the X-ray diffraction until Nb3Sn peaks appeared at 800 ℃ and 950 ℃ anneals. The strain () for a given plane was calculated by = (a<sup>T</sup> - a0) / a0, where a<sup>T</sup> is the measured lattice constant from Nb3Sn plane diffraction and a<sup>0</sup> is the lattice parameter from database [\\[34\\]](#page-13-17). (Internal strains calculated for all samples are summarized in Table S2.) The relative strain (∆), shown in figure [6a](#page-9-0), was obtained by normalizing strain to the hightemperature anneal limit where we observe negligible strains.\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>Here, we analyze the effect of film Figure 4. Surface SEM images for 2 <sup>µ</sup>m thick Nb3Sn\n\n![](_page_7_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n(a, b) and V3Si (c, d) films on Nb substrates: (a, c) as-deposited and (b, d) after 950 ℃ annealing.\n\nthickness on the strain. The internal strain () in a biaxial thin film system where inplane stresses are equal (δ = δ<sup>11</sup> = δ22) can be described by a linear relationship as = (2 S<sup>1</sup> + 1/2 S<sup>2</sup> sin<sup>2</sup>φ) δ, where φ is the angle from the film normal to the diffraction plane normal, and S<sup>1</sup> and S<sup>2</sup> are the Xray elastic constants that are determined, in an elastic isotropic scenario, by Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (υ) and given by – υ / E and (1 + υ) / E, respectively [\\[36\\]](#page-13-20). The built-in stress increases with film thickness (or deposition time at a fixed deposition rate) in a polycrystalline film system when the deposition goes beyond the initial instantaneous stress stage (< 10 nm thickness) [\\[35\\]](#page-13-19). This positive correlation, although slightly affected by the growthinterrupt stress relaxation effect and the heating effect, suggests high strain in the 2 µm thick film; however, the high in-plane stress during thicker film sputtering results in plastic deformation as indicated by the observation of small grain sizes and high density of boundaries (figure [4a](#page-7-0)).\n\nFurthermore, we cannot fully explain the Sn loss in the course of annealing the sputtered Nb3Sn films, i.e., the decrease of Sn/(Nb+Sn) atomic ratios with the increasing annealing temperature (figure [5a](#page-8-0)). Note that this Sn loss behavior is repeatedly observed in previous Nb3Sn sputtering work [\\[6,](#page-12-5) [12\\]](#page-12-11). At the annealing temperatures studied, pure Sn phases are not expected due to their low vaporization temperatures (e.g., 800 ℃ at 10<sup>−</sup><sup>6</sup> Torr), so we primarily consider Nb-Sn alloy phases in the film. The as-deposited film showed a 23 – 25% Sn atomic ratio which suggests minimal Sn-rich phases (Nb6Sn<sup>5</sup> and NbSn2) based on the Nb-Sn phase diagram [\\[3\\]](#page-12-2); these Sn-rich phases were also not observed in the X-ray diffraction. Without Sn or Sn-\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>Figure 5.

Note that the high Si ratios for Cu substrate samples are due to exclusion of Cu signals for calculation. As-deposited Sn/Si composition on 2 µm thick films are 23 – 25 %.

Such amorphous phases were reported when using non-equilibrium processing techniques [\\[38,](#page-13-0) [39\\]](#page-13-1). This could cause the loss of Sn alloys via the generation of α-Nb and also explain the appearance of Nb3Sn diffraction for anneals above 800 ℃, which likely corresponds to the crystallization temperature. This requires further investigation.\n\n3.2.2. 2 µm thick V3Si films Different from thick Nb3Sn films, the as-deposited 2 µm thick V3Si film (figure [6b](#page-9-0)) exhibits a high strain of 15%, which supports the positive relationship between strain and film thickness in an elastic scenario for thick (> 10 nm) polycrystalline films. The initial film shows a near-stoichiometric value of Si (∼ 23%) shown in figure [5b](#page-8-0).\n\nUpon annealing, the V3Si film shows a constant Si concentration for all temperatures; see figure [5a](#page-8-0). In contrast, the strain within the film is significantly relieved together with a transition from the unstable V3Si structure to the stable structure between 800 ℃ and 950 ℃ (figure [6b](#page-9-0)). The structural transformation is observed through the shifting of the (220) and (222) diffraction peaks in figure [6c](#page-9-0). These behaviors demonstrate that thermal annealing contributes to strain reduction and structural stabilization in a thick sputtered film. However, as shown in figure [4d](#page-7-0), large cracks begin to appear on the film after the first anneal at 600 ℃, coinciding with a shift toward a more angular grain shape with increasing temperature. The high strain induced by the sputtering deposition is responsible for the cracks although thermal relaxation has reduced a significant amount of lattice strain.\n\n# 3.3. Nb3Sn and V3Si films on Cu substrates: ternary alloy systems\n\nBy studying the temperature-atomic percentage phase diagrams of Nb-Sn [\\[3\\]](#page-12-0) and V-Si [\\[45\\]](#page-14-0), as well as the three-element composition phase diagrams of Cu-Nb-Sn [\\[40,](#page-13-2) [41,](#page-13-3) [42\\]](#page-13-4) and Cu-V-Si [\\[43,](#page-14-1) [44\\]](#page-14-2), we can gain insight into the phase transformations our films undergo during the annealing process.\n\nAs shown in figures [7a](#page-10-0) and [7c](#page-10-0), 300 nm thick Nb3Sn and V3Si films were sputtered on Cu substrates using a 550 ℃ in situ heating stage. Upon annealing, both films undergo dramatic grain structure changes due to the generation of Cu-Sn or Cu-Si phases. Nb3Sn grains start with rounded grains collecting in finger-like formations as deposited on a Cu surface (figure [7a](#page-10-0)) and they remelt into small angular grains collecting in regions of differing densities after 950 ℃ anneal (figure [7b](#page-10-0)). In contrast, V3Si grains begin with a finger-like pattern after deposition (figure [7c](#page-10-0)) and end with small angular grains and large artifacts scattered across the surface after 950 ℃ anneal (figure [7d](#page-10-0)). Overall, there is a trend of grain angularization and pattern restructuring with increasing temperature.\n\n<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>The ternary phase transformation that includes Cu-alloy in the films primarily determines the film properties. As shown in figure [5a](#page-8-0), the 300 nm Nb3Sn films on Cu substrates suffer from the Sn loss similar to 2 µm thick films on Nb substrates, but the mechanism is different. According to the Nb-Sn-Cu phase diagram [\\[40,](#page-13-2) [41,](#page-13-3) [42\\]](#page-13-4), Cu-Sn and Nb-Sn phases generate at low temperatures (e.g., 675 ℃ [\\[40\\]](#page-13-2)) and these Cu-Sn transform into liquid at 800 ℃ under atmospheric pressure [\\[41\\]](#page-13-3), and at high temperatures (e.g., 1000 ℃ [\\[42\\]](#page-13-4)), only Nb3Sn and Cu exist. In\n\n![](0__page_10_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\nour study, high-vacuum annealing vaporized Figure 7. Surface SEM images for 300 nm Nb3Sn (a, b) and V3Si (c, d) films on Cu substrates: (a, c) as-deposited and (b, d) after 950 ℃ annealing.\n\nthe Cu-Sn phases leading to a continuous loss of Sn with increasing temperature. Also, we observed low-intensity Nb3Sn diffraction at all temperatures whereas convoluted XRD peaks that are possibly from Cu-Sn and other Nb-Sn phases appeared at low temperatures. These observations match with the existence of Nb3Sn in the phase diagram at high temperatures although the majority of the film was evaporated.\n\nDifferent from Nb-Sn-Cu, the V-Si-Cu phase diagram [\\[43,](#page-14-1) [44\\]](#page-14-2) shows Cu-Si and V-Si phases at low temperatures (e.g., 700 ℃ [\\[43\\]](#page-14-1)), but there is no liquid phase at high temperatures (e.g., 800 ℃ [\\[44\\]](#page-14-2)). Instead, these phases transform into V-Si and Cu phases. In our study, as shown in figure [5a](#page-8-0), the Si/(Si+V) ratio begins with a high value of 42% due to the presence of Cu-Si phases generated during the 550 ℃ in situ heated deposition; note that Cu signal is evident, but is not included in the calculation. After annealing, the Si/(Si+V) ratio drops to 20% at 950 ℃. This phenomenon strongly supports the disappearance of Cu-Si phases in the phase diagram, and only V-Si phases together with some Cu metallic inclusions are expected in the annealed films. Our diffraction data suggest these V-Si phases include the stable (220) and unstable (222) V3Si structures.\n\n#### 4. Conclusions and Outlook\n\nIn this study, we have demonstrated the capability of annealing the sputtered thin films to produce successful Nb3Sn and V3Si surfaces that have the potential for use inside SRF cavities. We observe that annealing is required to release the strain in the film and promote grain growth. For our Nb3Sn samples, the best results are found on the recrystallized 100 nm film, where large grains form at 950 ℃ anneals. These films are also smooth and have minimal surface defects. The 2 µm Nb3Sn films are not able to overcome the built-in stress and plastic deformation during sputtering, and likely form an amorphous Nb-Sn phase that leads to nearly complete Sn loss upon annealing. In contrast, the V3Si samples retain the stoichiometry at high temperatures, along with a transition in the grain shape to become more angular. Most interesting was the behavior of these films with respect to the unstable and stable phases of V3Si. In the 2 µm film, there was a complete transition from unstable to stable at 800 ℃ along with consistent stoichiometry. Because we observe this transition and the proper stoichiometry at high temperatures, we determine these are successful V3Si films.\n\nFor the Cu substrate samples, 550 °C in situ heated deposition and the subsequent lowtemperature anneals produce Cu-Si and Cu-Sn phases. These phases transform at high temperatures, extracting high concentrations of Cu inclusions in the film. The Cu impurities and Cu-related phases could adversely affect the SRF performance of Nb3Sn/V3Si films inside Cu cavities. In a future study, we would be interested in the use of an ultrathin buffer layer between the Cu and the superconducting layer to prevent this effect [\\[27\\]](#page-13-5).\n\nIn our results, we observed a similar Sn loss as in previous studies [\\[6\\]](#page-12-1). We are interested in finding ways to prevent this loss such as minimizing strong undercooling and avoiding disordered Nb-Sn phases or using encapsulation during the annealing process. We would like to obtain the benefits of annealing such as recrystallization and strain removal while avoiding events such as Sn loss and cracking. Because the 100 nm Nb3Sn film was successful, it would be important in a future study to further investigate films of\n\nsimilar thickness to optimize grain growth and RF performance.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available upon reasonable request from the authors.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Award PHY-1549132, the Center for Bright Beams.

However, sputtered films often suffer from stoichiometry and strain issues. This exploratory study investigates the structural and chemical effects of thermal annealing, both i n - s i t u and post-sputtering, on DC-sputtered Nb 3Sn and V 3Si films with varying thicknesses, deposited on Nb or Cu substrates. Building upon our initial studies [Howard et al., Proceedings of the SRF'21, East Lansing, MI (JACoW, 2021), p. 82.], we provide fundamental insights into recrystallization, phase changes, and the issues of stoichiometry and strain. Through annealing at 950 °C, we have successfully enabled the recrystallization of 100 nm thin Nb 3Sn films on Nb substrates, yielding stoichiometric and strain-free grains. For 2 μm thick films, elevated annealing temperatures led to the removal of internal strain and a slight increase in grain size. Moreover, annealing enabled a phase transformation from an unstable to a stable structure in V 3Si films, while we observed significant Sn loss in 2 μm thick Nb 3Sn films after high-temperature annealing. Similarly, annealing films atop Cu substrates resulted in notable Sn and Si loss due to the generation of Cu-Sn and Cu-Si phases, followed by evaporation. These results encourage us to refine our process to obtain high-quality sputtered films for SRF use.",
