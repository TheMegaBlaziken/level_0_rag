Pontiroli,<sup>2</sup> M. Mazzani,<sup>2</sup> and M. Ricc`o<sup>2</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup>Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, Universite Psris-Sud 11, CNRS UMR 8502, 91405 Orsay, France\n\n<sup>2</sup>Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit`a di Parma - Via G.P. Usberti 7/a, 43100 Parma, Italy\n\n(Dated: February 23, 2024)\n\nWe report an NMR and magnetometry study on the expanded intercalated fulleride Cs3C<sup>60</sup> in both its A15 and face centered cubic structures. NMR allowed us to evidence that both exhibit a first-order Mott transition to a superconducting (SC) state, occuring at distinct critical pressures p<sup>c</sup> and temperatures Tc. Though the ground state magnetism of the Mott phases differs, their high T paramagnetic and SC properties are found similar, and the phase diagrams versus unit volume per C<sup>60</sup> are superimposed. Thus, as expected for a strongly correlated system, the inter-ball distance is the relvevant parameter driving the electronic behavior and quantum transitions of these systems.\n\nPACS numbers: 71.30.+h, 74.70.Wz, 74.25.nj\n\nHigh transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity (SC) in the vicinity of magnetic phases is rather commonly found nowadays, especially in materials involving transition metal ions. There, the incidence of the spin fluctuations on the SC state and the symmetry of its order parameter is being highly debated and various possibilities have been considered depending whether the electronic states involved at the Fermi level reside on a single orbital (as in the cuprates) or multiorbital occupancy occurs (as for Fe pnictides).\n\nAlkali doped fullerides A3C<sup>60</sup> (A = alkali ion) represent a distinct family of HTSC in a multiorbital case, as the lowest unoccupied C<sup>60</sup> molecular orbitals (named t<sup>1</sup>u) are sixfold degenerate [\\[1](#page-3-1)]. The importance of electron correlations in AnC<sup>60</sup> compounds has been suggested first from the detection of insulating states for even n, contrary to the expected metallicity for any 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 in an independent electron picture. On-ball localization of pairs of electrons is favored by the energy gain due to Jahn-Teller (JT) distorsions of the charged C<sup>60</sup> molecules which adds to the coulomb energy U. The occurrence of this Mott Jahn-Teller insulator [\\[2](#page-3-2)], in which Hund's rule is violated, has been confirmed by the observation by NMR of a spin gap due to singlet-triplet excitations, smaller than the optical gap, for both crystal structures of A4C<sup>60</sup> [\\[3\\]](#page-3-3) and Na2C<sup>60</sup> [\\[4\\]](#page-3-4). Furthermore for n = 1, in fcc-CsC60, the observation of charge segregation of singlet electron pairs on a sizable fraction of the C<sup>60</sup> balls at low T has been an even more direct evidence that electron pairs are favored by JT distortions [\\[5](#page-3-5)].\n\nFor n = 3, JT distortions were expected to be less effective. So the s-wave SC evidenced in the fcc-A3C60, and the scaling of T<sup>c</sup> with the distance between C<sup>60</sup> balls has been interpreted by most researchers as purely BCS, driven by on ball phonons, with weak incidence of electronic correlations [\\[1\\]](#page-3-1). The effort to increase T<sup>c</sup> by expanding the C<sup>60</sup> lattice has, however, led to the discovery of various magnetic compounds, such as (NH3)xK3C60, which displays a Mott transition to a SC state under pressure [\\[6\\]](#page-3-6). But one was still led to suspect that this behavior could be attributed to a lifting of the degeneracy of the t<sup>1</sup><sup>u</sup> levels by the peculiar lattice structure required to expand the C<sup>60</sup> lattice [\\[7](#page-3-7)]. The most expanded fulleride Cs3C<sup>60</sup> had been found to become SC under pressure (p), with T<sup>c</sup> ≃ 40 K [\\[8](#page-3-8)], but it has only recently been shown that this occurs in a cubic A15 structure [\\[9](#page-3-9)]. A renewed interest arises then as this phase is antiferromagnetic (AF) at ambient p, with T<sup>N</sup> = 47 K [\\[10\\]](#page-3-10), and undergoes a Mott transition to a metallic state for p ∼ 4 kbar. It is then of great interest to find out whether the electronic properties of A15-Cs3C<sup>60</sup> exhibit any difference with those of other fcc-A3C<sup>60</sup> phases.\n\nGanin et al. indicated that the low-temperature reaction process [\\[9](#page-3-9)] used to synthesize A15-Cs3C<sup>60</sup> produces mixed phases including fcc-Cs3C<sup>60</sup> and body centered orthorhombic bco-Cs4C60. Using the spectroscopic capabilities of <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR experiments, we sorted out the signals from the two Cs3C<sup>60</sup> isomers in such mixed-phase samples. Taking that in advantage, we report in this letter the first direct comparison, and demonstrate that a Mott transition to SC occurs as well in fcc-Cs3C60. At ambient pressure, we evidence the decrease of spin freezing temperature for the fcc as compared to that of the A15 phase and associate it with the geometrical frustration of the former lattice. The occurrence of a Mott transiton is shown to be independent of the crystal structure and of the specific C<sup>60</sup> ball orientational (merohedral) disorder present in fcc-Cs3C60. This confers then a very important place to these phases in helping to reach an understanding of SC in the vicinity of magnetic phases.\n\n<sup>133</sup>Cs NMR spectra of the two phases.— We could synthesize mixed-phase samples and selected three of them with significantly differing phase contents, labelled A1 and A2 for A15 rich and F1 for the fcc rich. Their compositions are A1 (58.4, 12, 29.5), A2 (41.7, 12, 46.5) , F1( 34, 55, 11), where the % contents in formula units are given respectively for the A15, fcc and bco phases. As <sup>133</sup>Cs has a nuclear spin I = 7/2, its NMR spectrum is sensitive to the local site symmetry through the coupling of the nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>FIG. 1: a) The A15 <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR spectrum taken at ambient pressure displays a seven-peak powder NMR spectrum (arrows), with a quadrupole splitting of ∼ 39 kHz at 100 K, and a slight asymmetric spectral shape originating from a Knight shift anisotropy. b) <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR spectra for the fcc phase displaying the octahedral O and tetrahedral sites peaks, T and T'. c) and d) The spectra are found nearly unmodified at 7.6 kbar when both phases are metallic (see text).\n\nfield gradient (EFG) induced by the local charge distribution. So in the A15 phase the single NMR site displays a quadrupole-split seven-line spectrum (Fig. [1a](#page-1-0)), as the unique Cs site displays a non-cubic local symmetry [\\[11\\]](#page-3-11). In the fcc phase, the unit cell contains two alkali sites, with occupancy ratio 1:2 for the octahedral (O) and tetrahedral (T) sites. Their local symmetry being cubic, the EFG vanishes and each site has a narrow non-split signal. A peculiarity evidenced by NMR [\\[12\\]](#page-4-0) in all formerly known fcc-A3C<sup>60</sup> is that the tetrahedral site splits into two sites (T and T') which have been assigned to the merohedral disorder of C<sup>60</sup> balls [\\[13\\]](#page-4-1). The detection in sample F1 of these three lines (Fig. [1b](#page-1-0)) establishes then the identical structure of fcc-Cs3C60. This difference in NMR spectra allowed us, as done indeed in Fig. [1,](#page-1-0) to detect selectively the <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR of a given phase. Let us point out, as will be discussed later, that the data of Fig. [1c](#page-1-0) demonstrates that these structures are not modified under pressure.\n\nParamagnetism at ambient pressure.— SQUID data on all samples do not display any superconductivity for p = 1 bar, and only exhibit a paramagnetic susceptibility\n\n$$\n\\chi(T) = \\chi\\_{orb} + \\chi\\_s(T),\n$$\n\nwhich includes an orbital term and a T dependence due to the spin magnetism of unpaired electrons. The data were similar to those attributed to the A15 phase [\\[10\\]](#page-3-10). Comparisons between the two phases are possible from analyses of the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra, as the NMR shift involves also orbital and spin components\n\n$$K^{\\alpha} = K\\_{orb}^{\\alpha} + K\\_s^{\\alpha}(T) = K\\_{orb}^{\\alpha} + \\\nA^{\\alpha} \\chi\\_s(T).$$\n\nHere, index α refers to the direction of the appplied field B with respect to local axes on the <sup>13</sup>C site.

The spin freezing is monitored in the inset by the variation of the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>133</sup>Cs signal intensities taken on sample F1(see text).\n\nbonding electrons [\\[14\\]](#page-4-2), and K<sup>α</sup> s (T ) associated with the spin magnetization of electrons in the t<sup>1</sup><sup>u</sup> orbitals are anisotropic [\\[15\\]](#page-4-3). The random orientation of the balls with respect to B gives a typical <sup>13</sup>C powder NMR spectrum, with two singularities for K<sup>⊥</sup> and K|| which correspond to B directions ⊥ and || to the tangential plane to the C<sup>60</sup> ball at the <sup>13</sup>C site, as shown in the inset of Fig. [2a](#page-1-1). One can notice there that, at T = 160 K, the spectra are identical for the A15 and fcc rich samples.\n\nFurthermore, in Fig. [2a](#page-1-1) the T variations of the anisotropy Kax = 2(K<sup>⊥</sup> − K||)/3 , which is obtained from fits of the spectra, cannot be differenciated for the two phases above 100 K and track those of SQUID data for χ taken on sample A1. The deduced data for χs(T ) are then intrinsic and similar for both phases and can be fitted above 100 K with a Curie-Weiss law with an effective moment peff = 1.52(5) µ<sup>B</sup> per C<sup>60</sup> and a Weiss temperature Θ<sup>W</sup> = −70 ± 5 K. Such a value for peff let us suggest that the C3<sup>−</sup> <sup>60</sup> ion is in a low spin state in the fcc phase as established before for the A15 phase [\\[10](#page-3-10), [11\\]](#page-3-11).\n\nMagnetic ordering at ambient pressure.— For all samples the SQUID data exhibits a sharp increase of magnetization at T = 47 K due to the AF state of the fraction of A15 phase as shown in Fig. [2a](#page-1-1). We also detected the increased linewidth of the A15 phase <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR signal\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>FIG. 3: (color on line) SC diamagnetism is detected at a lower p<sup>c</sup> for the sample F1 than for A2 (nearly pure A15). The arrows point the values of Tc(p) deduced by extrapolation of the sharp T dependent diamagnetism (slightly smaller than the onset values). The diamagnetic magnetization at 10K (extrapolated for some p values) is displayed in the inset for both samples. The magnetic volume fraction is also shown for the A15 phase.\n\nfound in Ref. [\\[10,](#page-3-10) [11](#page-3-11)]. We could as well find in the A15 rich sample that the magnetization on the C<sup>60</sup> ball induces such a large broadening of the <sup>13</sup>C NMR that its intensity, detected within a small frequency window of 100 kHz (that is 0.01 T), vanishes below T<sup>N</sup> = 47 K. This allowed us then in sample F1, after the loss of the A15 fraction (∼ 40 %), to isolate below 47K the fcc <sup>13</sup>C NMR. The paramagnetism of this phase, given by Kax , decreases slightly with respect to its high T value, as seen in Fig. [2a](#page-1-1).\n\nSpin freezing in the fcc is only detected below T<sup>f</sup> ≃ 10 K from the sharp intensity drops of both the<sup>13</sup>C and the fcc- specific <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR signal, shown in the insert of Fig. [2b](#page-1-1). This latter observation establishes that in the fcc-frozen spin state the internal field on the <sup>133</sup>Cs site is much larger than that in the A15 AF phase for which the integrated intensity over a 100 kHz window only slightly declines below T<sup>N</sup> . This confirms that the transferred internal field on <sup>133</sup>Cs is partly compensated in the A15 AF phase due to the bipartite body centered lattice symmetry [\\[11\\]](#page-3-11). On the contrary this large internal fields on <sup>133</sup>Cs and the small T<sup>f</sup> value give evidence that the fcc phase magnetic state is influenced by the inherent frustration of the fcc lattice.\n\nTo compare the dynamical magnetic properties, <sup>133</sup>Cs spin lattice relaxation T<sup>1</sup> data have been taken on the two phases. In the fcc, the less shifted O site could only be resolved above 50 K, and its T<sup>1</sup> scales by a factor\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n3\n\n<span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>FIG. 4: (color on line) Phase diagram reporting the critical temperatures (a) versus p, (b) versus V<sup>C</sup><sup>60</sup> . The pressures p<sup>c</sup> of the Mott transitions shown as dotted lines in (a) merge into the gray area in (b). There we reported for comparison the former data on A15 phase [\\[10](#page-3-10)] as a dotted line, and on the other fcc-A3C<sup>60</sup> as empty downward triangles [\\[16](#page-4-4)].\n\nthree with that of the T site, as seen in Fig. [2b](#page-1-1). So both sites sense the same magnetic fluctuations through distinct hyperfine couplings. For the T site, (T1T ) −1 follows in the paramagnetic regime a similar variation as that seen in the A15 phase. There, below T<sup>N</sup> = 47 K a sharp gap in the spin excitations is detected and the data can be fitted with (T1T ) <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ∝ exp(−∆/kBT ), with ∆ ≃ 50 K (full line on Fig. [2b](#page-1-1)). On the contrary in the fcc phase (T1T ) −1 remains nearly constant down to 10 K and even displays a fast increase for the <sup>133</sup>Cs nuclear spins which are not submitted to a large static field. This persistence of spin fluctuations at low T is also to be linked to frustration effects.\n\nSC phases under pressure and phase diagram.— SC diamagnetism could be probed in situ by monitoring the shift of the NMR coil tuning frequency (f ≃ 28 MHz). This allowed us to estimate the SC volume fractions, as we kept the geometry unchanged during the pressure sweeps. We find here that the fcc phase displays a transition to a SC state at 3.9 kbar (sample F1), while this occurs only above 5.5 kbar in the A15 rich (A2), which points out that the critical pressure p<sup>c</sup> for the magnetic-SC transition is lower for the fcc phase than for the A15. This can be seen in the insert of Fig. [3,](#page-2-0) where the magnitude of the diamagnetic signal measured at 10 K is plotted versus p. It is as well compared for the A15 phase with the magnetic volume fraction estimated from the <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR. The abrupt loss of magnetism above 7 kbar and onset of SC above 6 kbar points for the first order AF/SC phase boundaries at p<sup>c</sup> = 6.5(5) kbar in the A15 and p<sup>c</sup> = 3.5(5) kbar in the fcc phase.\n\nWe can then report the (p, T ) phase diagrams in Fig. [4a](#page-2-1), and do find in Fig. [4b](#page-2-1) that p<sup>c</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> merge together for the two Cs3C<sup>60</sup> phases if plotted versus V<sup>C</sup><sup>60</sup> , the unit volume per C<sup>60</sup> ball [\\[17](#page-4-5)]. There, we can as well compare the present T<sup>c</sup> data with former results on the\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-12\"></span>FIG. 5: T variations of (T1T ) −1 for <sup>133</sup>Cs and <sup>13</sup>C (left scale) and of the <sup>133</sup>Cs shift K (blue empty diamonds right scale) in the A15 phase above pc. The magnitude of the T site <sup>133</sup>Cs relaxation rate in the fcc compound is found similar to that obtained in the A15 compound (see text).\n\nother fcc-A3C60, and we evidence that a similar maximum of T<sup>c</sup> versus V<sup>C</sup><sup>60</sup> applies for the two structures.\n\nLet us now consider the NMR data taken at high enough p, for which both phases become SC at low T . It is first clear, as seen in Fig. [1,](#page-1-0) that the spectra above T<sup>c</sup> do not differ from those taken at one bar. This absence of structural modification for both phases establishes then that the evolution with p only implies electronic degrees of freedom.\n\nIn the metallic state, a Korringa-like T independent T1T is seen above T<sup>c</sup> for the two phases as shown in Fig. [5.](#page-3-12) The constant values are similar for <sup>133</sup>Cs in the A15 as for the T site of the fcc, which displayed similar T<sup>1</sup> in the paramagnetic phases as well (Fig. [2b](#page-1-1)). This points that the spin dynamics has comparable evolution with pressure in the two phases. In the A15, the opening of the SC gap at Tc, as detected from the onset of decrease in the <sup>133</sup>Cs Knight shift <sup>133</sup>K, occurs slightly above the observed decrease in (T1T ) −1 for both <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>133</sup>Cs nuclei. This result perfectly mimics the observations done in high applied fields in the other fcc-A3C<sup>60</sup> compounds [\\[18\\]](#page-4-6). There, such a persistence of spin excitations slightly below T<sup>c</sup> are remnants of the s-wave BCS like Hebel-Slichter coherence peak [\\[19\\]](#page-4-7), which is damped in high fields and could only be fully revealed from low field data [\\[1](#page-3-1)].\n\nSummary and discussion.— In conclusion we have shown here that the magnetic ground states of the Cs3C<sup>60</sup> phases are quite distinct at ambient pressure. The reduction of ordering temperature and the persistence of low-energy spin fluctuations at low T in the fcc phase can be assigned to the frustration effects inherent to this structure and its merohedral disorder. We further evidenced that no major crystal structure modification occurs under pressure as shown as well from x-ray spectra in the A15 phase [\\[10](#page-3-10)]. So the low T transition from a magnetic to a SC state, which appears to be of first order, is fully determined by electronic parameters in both cases. Comparison of the phase diagrams demonstrates that the crititical pressure p<sup>c</sup> for the transition occurs for a similar value of the volume per C<sup>60</sup> ball VC<sup>60</sup> , which highlights the Mottness of the transition to be opposed to a CDW/SDW transition, which should sensitively depend on lattice and Fermi surface symmetry.\n\nOur data evidences that fcc-A3C<sup>60</sup> compounds exhibit a dome behavior of Tc(VC<sup>60</sup> ), identical to that found in the A15 phase under pressure. This unexpected feature in a purely BCS s-wave scenario dominated by a density of state variation is then quite generic. Our result gives then weight to the theoretical attempts to take correlation and JT effects into account in these systems [\\[20\\]](#page-4-8), which did suggest such a behavior beforehand. We are presently investigating the evolution of the spin dynamics accross the Mott transition, which should permit more thorough comparisons with such theoretical approaches, and hope that the present work will trigger diverse other experimental studies of the electronic properties of the Cs3C<sup>60</sup> phases across the Mott transition.\n\nWe would like to thank V.

NMR allowed us to evidence that both exhibit a first-order Mott transition to a superconducting state, occurring at distinct critical pressures p<SUB>c</SUB> and temperatures T<SUB>c</SUB>. Though the ground state magnetism of the Mott phases differs, their high T paramagnetic and superconducting properties are found similar, and the phase diagrams versus unit volume per C<SUB>60</SUB> are superimposed. Thus, as expected for a strongly correlated system, the interball distance is the relevant parameter driving the electronic behavior and quantum transitions of these systems.",
