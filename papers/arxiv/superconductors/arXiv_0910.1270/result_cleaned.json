Toyota<sup>2</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup>Physik-Institut University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland\n\n<sup>2</sup>Physics Department, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, 980-8571 Sendai, Japan\n\nBy the application of a small oscillating magnetic field parallel to the main magnetic field and perpendicular to the transport current, we were able to unveil the peak effect in the resistivity data of Nb3Sn near the upper critical field Hc<sup>2</sup>. We investigated the dependence of this effect on the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field and show that the used technique can be more sensitive to detect the peak effect in a certain range of temperatures and magnetic fields than conventional magnetization measurements.\n\nPACS numbers: 74.70.Ad, 74.25.F-, 74.25.Uv\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nVortex matter in type-II superconductors exhibits a huge variety of interesting effects, the investigation of which can provide information on the vortex dynamics and flux-line lattice (FLL) structures [\\[1](#page-5-1)]. For example, the occurrence of a maximum in the critical current as the external magnetic field H is varied near the upper-critical magnetic field H<sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> of certain hard superconductors, is known as the so-called peak effect. At temperatures close to the critical temperature T<sup>c</sup> the flux-line lattice softens, and the magnetic-flux lines can adjust better to the pinning centers, which in turn leads to a higher pinning strength and thereby to an increase in the critical current. An increased pinning strength manifests itself as a \"bubblelike\" feature in dc magnetization-hysteresis data that results from an enhanced irreversibility and consequently a large difference between the two branches (increasing and decreasing magnetic field) of corresponding M(H) data at the peak effect. The peak effect has been observed in different physical quantities, such as ac susceptibility [\\[2,](#page-5-2) [3](#page-5-3)], dc magnetization [\\[4](#page-5-4)], and even in electrical-transport measurements [\\[5](#page-5-5)[–13\\]](#page-5-6).\n\nAccording to recent theories [\\[14](#page-5-7)[–24\\]](#page-6-0), transversal and also longitudinal \"flux-line shaking\" (relative to the major screening-sheet-current direction inside the superconducting sample) with an oscillating magnetic field (\"shaking field\") hac can cause flux lines to \"walk\" through the superconductor, which leads to a reduction of nonequilibrium effects in the current distribution and thereby to an equilibration of the FFL. This technique has been successfully applied, for example, for resistivity measurements [\\[25\\]](#page-6-1), torque magnetometry [\\[26,](#page-6-2) [27](#page-6-3)], local magnetization measurements [\\[28\\]](#page-6-4), and also for specificheat investigations [\\[29](#page-6-5)].\n\nWe have measured the resistivity of a Nb3Sn single crystal while applying a shaking field hac parallel to the main dc magnetic field H (so-called hac k H configuration) and in the presence of a transport current oriented perpendicular to H. This configuration is different from, e.g., the setup of Cape and Silvera [\\[25\\]](#page-6-1) who applied the small shaking field perpendicular to the main dc magnetic field (so-called hac ⊥ H configuration), a geometry that has been extensively theoretically studied by Brandt et al. [\\[14](#page-5-7)[–18,](#page-5-8) [20](#page-6-6)[–24](#page-6-0)]. In Fig. [1](#page-1-0) we show a schematic view of the two configurations hac k H and hac ⊥ H, respectively. Only a very few experiments have been reported in the literature with a transport current in combination with a shaking field [\\[30](#page-6-7)[–33](#page-6-8)]. A configuration that is comparable to ours and with a similar shaking technique was used by Huebener and Rowe [\\[30](#page-6-7)] to study lead films and by Risse et al. [\\[33](#page-6-8)] who investigated amorphous Mo3Si films with a similar shaking technique.\n\nThe magnetic response of a flat regularly shaped superconducting sample in the mixed state to an oscillatory magnetic field component parallel to the sample surface is strictly symmetric, i.e., magnetic-flux lines enter and leave the sample on opposite edges in the same way. This geometrical symmetry is lifted as soon as an additional transport current is applied. As a result, the formation of a dc electric field parallel to the transport current is expected to occur, leading to a finite resistance [\\[19](#page-6-9), [33\\]](#page-6-8). We applied this configuration to a Nb3Sn single crystal and report on the novel option to unveil the peak effect in the resistivity data by the continuous application of a shaking field hac parallel to the main magnetic field H.\n\n## EXPERIMENT\n\nThe Nb3Sn single crystal used for this study (mass m ≈ 11.9 mg, thickness d ≈ 0.4 mm, and cross section A ≈ 0.44 mm<sup>2</sup> ) was characterized by Toyota et al. [\\[34](#page-6-10)] and was further investigated by Lortz et al. for calorimetric experiments [\\[4](#page-5-4), [29,](#page-6-5) [35\\]](#page-6-11). The transition to superconductivity in zero magnetic field as determined by a resistivity measurement occurs at T<sup>c</sup> ≈ 18.0 K.\n\nResistivity measurements were performed in a commercial physical property measurement system (PPMS), Quantum Design in a four-point configuration. These measurements were performed in the so-called ac mode,\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>FIG. 1: Schematic drawing of the configurations (a) hac k H plus a transport current I<sup>m</sup> ; (b) hac ⊥ H, with no transport current . The sheet current J<sup>c</sup> generates the diamagnetic response of the superconductor.\n\nwhere a dc current abruptly switches its direction 15 times/s (square-wave excitation). The external main magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the flat side of the crystal (H k c) and also perpendicular to the transport current (see Fig. [1\\(](#page-1-0)a)).\n\nWe mounted an ac shaking coil with 1306 windings on a commercial PPMS resistivity puck with its axis aligned with the main magnetic field so that hac k H. In order to monitor the amplitude of the shaking field hac we installed an additional pick-up coil inside this ac shaking coil. To achieve an accurate measurement of the sample temperature, we attached a calibrated thermometer (Cernox, LakeShore Inc.) at the top of a brass block supporting the sample. The ac shaking coil was driven by an external ac power source (Agilent model 6811B).\n\nAdditional dc magnetization measurements were performed in the same PPMS using the commercial standard option.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nEarlier investigations on the same Nb3Sn crystal have shown that it exhibits a pronounced magnetic peak effect near H<sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> [\\[4](#page-5-4)]. We have performed additional dc magnetization measurements on this crystal and show in Figs. [2\\(](#page-1-1)a) and [2\\(](#page-1-1)b) corresponding magnetization hysteresis loops for the crystal taken at different temperatures. The bubble-like feature near the upper critical field is caused by the peak effect. In Fig. [3](#page-1-2) we have plotted the critical currents I<sup>c</sup> in the peak-effect region as estimated from the magnetization-hysteresis loops shown in Fig. [2\\(](#page-1-1)b) by using Bean's critical-state model.\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span>FIG. 2: (a) Dc magnetization-hysteresis curve for T = 13 K. (b) Parts of the dc magnetization hysteresis curves for different temperatures (from left to right) : T = 15.5 K, 15 K, 14.5 K, 14 K, 13.5 K, 13 K, 12.5 K, 12 K.\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_10.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-2\"></span>FIG. 3: (Color online) Ic(B) data as obtained from the magnetization measurements shown in Figs.

While the data shown in Fig. [4\\(](#page-2-0)a) were taken without any shaking field hac, the data displayed in Fig. [4\\(](#page-2-0)b) were measured with µ0hac = 0.58 mT k H.

(b) With an oscillating magnetic field (f = 1 kHz, µ0hac = 0.58 mT) superimposed.\n\nsition to superconductivity is discernible. This observation indicates that no significant depinning occurs for T < Tc(H) with a transport current I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA. With an additional shaking field hac of frequency f = 1 kHz parallel to the main magnetic field, (hac k H), however, a clear signature due to the peak effect appears for µ0H ≤ 3 T, which is the central result of this paper. The data taken in larger magnetic fields remain unaffected. This signature consists of a region with finite resistance for temperatures T well below T<sup>c</sup> which we may attribute to the dissipative motion of magnetic vortices, and a pronounced drop right below T<sup>c</sup> that must indicate enhanced flux pinning in the peak-effect region (see discussion below).\n\nIn Figs. [5](#page-2-1) we show similar data as in Figs. [4,](#page-2-0) but with the transport current reduced by an order of magnitude to I<sup>m</sup> = 0.5 mA.\n\nWe have also systematically studied the dependence of R(T ) on the frequency f of the shaking field. In Fig. [6](#page-3-0) we show corresponding temperature sweeps R(T ) for frequencies between 5 Hz and 5 kHz. Very strikingly, only frequencies f & 1 kHz induced a significant resistance well below Tc.\n\n<span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>FIG. 5: (Color online) Resistance R(T ) of a Nb3Sn single crystal for different magnetic fields, measured with I<sup>m</sup> = 0.5 mA. (a) Without an oscillating magnetic field, i.e., hac = 0. (b) With an oscillating magnetic field (f = 1 kHz, µ0hac = 0.58 mT) superimposed.\n\nWe finally investigated the dependence of R(T ) on the amplitude hac of the shaking field at fixed frequency f = 1 kHz (see Fig. [7\\)](#page-3-1). A significant resistance below T<sup>c</sup> appears abruptly above a certain threshold value, µ0hac ≈ 0.3 mT. To demonstrate this effect more clearly we have plotted in Fig. [8](#page-3-2) corresponding data taken at a constant T = 15.8 K, where the sample resistance becomes finite at µ0hac ≈ 0.4 mT. The apparent discrepancy between the observed threshold values for hac appearing in Figs. [7](#page-3-1) and [8](#page-3-2) may be a consequence of a certain irreversible behavior around the peak-effect region, so that experiments with varying temperature and corresponding measurements with varying magnetic field (and at fixed T ) may not give exactly the same results.\n\nIn order to discuss these features in the R(T ) curves that show the peak effect, we plotted in Fig. [9](#page-3-3) a selected R(T ) curve for µ0H = 3 T. We define the temperatures T<sup>p</sup> as the temperature at the local minimum, T<sup>M</sup> as the temperature at the local maximum of the R(T ) curve, respectively, and ∆T as the distance on the temperature scale between the local maximum of the resistance at T<sup>M</sup> and the sharp increase in R(T ) at the transition to the normal state near T<sup>c</sup> (see Fig. [9\\)](#page-3-3).\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>FIG. 6: (Color online) Temperature sweeps R(T ) for µ0H = 3 T, fixed hac = 0.29 mT and I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA, but different \"shaking\" frequencies f.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>FIG. 7: (Color online) Temperature sweeps R(T ) for µ0H = 3 T, fixed frequency f = 1 kHz, I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA, but different amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field hac.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-2\"></span>FIG. 8: Resistance R for different amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field hac in µ0H = 3 T, T = 15.8 K, I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA and fixed frequency f = 1 kHz.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-3\"></span>FIG. 9: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the resistance R(T ) for a fixed external magnetic field µ0H = 3 T, with an oscillating magnetic field (f = 1 kHz, µ0hac = 0.58 mT) superimposed and I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nA minimum in the resistance R(T ) at T<sup>p</sup> close to Tc, as observed in electrical transport measurements on, e.g., V3Si [\\[6,](#page-5-9) [7\\]](#page-5-10), Nb3Ge, Mo3Si [\\[8](#page-5-11)], 2H-NbSe<sup>2</sup> [\\[5,](#page-5-5) [9\\]](#page-5-12), Nb [\\[10](#page-5-13), [11\\]](#page-5-14), CeRu2, CeCo2, Yb3Rh4Sn<sup>13</sup> [\\[12](#page-5-15)], and YBa2Cu3O<sup>7</sup> [\\[13](#page-5-6)], has usually been interpreted as a manifestation of the peak effect. In all these cited experiments, such a minimum was observed without the aid of a superimposed ac field. Only in Ref. [\\[6\\]](#page-5-9) the authors used a configuration comparable to ours by cycling of the main magnetic field prior to their measurements on V3Si in order to restore the signature of the peak effect. In our measurements on Nb3Sn, however, such a characteristic feature in R(T ) appears by the continuous application of a shaking field hac, which allows us to restore the peak effect in a very convenient and efficient way with a high data-point density. This shaking field hac exerts a periodic Lorentz force on the magnetic flux lines, in combination with an additional constant force induced by the used transport current Im. As soon as these combined forces exceed the pinning force, the flux lines will be depinned and the resulting dissipative motion causes a finite resistance for T < Tc. According to an explanation of the peak effect by Pippard [\\[36](#page-6-12)], the FLL softens in the peak-effect region, i.e., the shear modulus is vastly reduced, the FLL becomes less rigid, and the flux lines can bend and adjust better to the pinning sites. Since the resulting pinning is stronger in the peak-effect region, the motion of the flux lines is hindered and therefore the resistance decreases. This increased pinning strength leads to an increase in the critical current, which can also be observed as a drop in the real part of the ac susceptibility (see, for example, Refs. [\\[2](#page-5-2)] and [\\[3\\]](#page-5-3)).\n\nTo prove that the observed features in R(T ) at T<sup>p</sup> coincide with the magnetically determined peak effect, we\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG. 10: (Color online) Part of the magnetic phase diagram of the Nb3Sn single crystal as derived from the data shown in Figs. [2](#page-1-1) and [4.](#page-2-0) Filled circles : upper critical field; open circles : Tp; open squares : center of the peak-effect region from M(H) data. Inset : magnetic-field dependence of the width of the peak-effect region ∆H. Circles represent data as deduced from the resistivity measurements of Fig. [4\\(](#page-2-0)b), while squares stand for data extracted from the dc magnetization measurements shown in Figs. [2.](#page-1-1)\n\nshow in Fig. [10](#page-4-0) the results from Figs. [2\\(](#page-1-1)b) and [4](#page-2-0) in one magnetic phase diagram. The lines correspond to the position of the center of the peak-effect region and seem to match for both data sets, which strongly supports the interpretation of the observed drop in resistance at T<sup>p</sup> as a signature of the peak effect. The vertical and horizontal bars drawn in this figure are derived from the widths of the respective features that we ascribe to the peak effect. The inset of Fig. [10](#page-4-0) shows the magnetic-field dependence of the width ∆H on the magnetic-field scale for both data sets, where we have converted ∆T according to ∆H = ∆T dH<sup>c</sup>2/dT . The ∆H as derived from the resistivity data also essentially coincide with the corresponding widths extracted from the dc magnetization data.\n\nAdesso et al. [\\[3](#page-5-3)] investigated the same Nb3Sn crystal by studying the higher harmonics of the ac magnetic susceptibility χac. The peak effect was detected in magnetic fields between 3 and 13 T, and the resulting magnetic phase diagram is in line with ours (Fig. [10\\)](#page-4-0).\n\nIn the following we discuss the dependence of the observed features in R(T ) on the transport current Im, on the oscillation frequency f, and on the amplitude hac. Reducing the transport current to I<sup>m</sup> = 0.5 mA leads naturally to more scattered data in Figs. [5](#page-2-1) as compared to the measurements for I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA shown in Figs. [4.](#page-2-0) Noteworthy, flux-line motion sets in at µ0H = 2 T and below for I<sup>m</sup> = 0.5 mA (Fig. [5\\(](#page-2-1)b)), while it already occurs in µ0H = 3 T for the higher transport current I<sup>m</sup> = 5 mA (Fig. [4\\(](#page-2-0)b)). This trend can be explained if one assumes, in line with the Anderson-Kim flux creep theory [\\[37\\]](#page-6-13), that a large transport current leads to a higher mobility of flux-line bundles due to the stronger Lorentz force as compared to a situation with a small current Im.\n\nThe existence of a threshold frequency above which a finite resistance below T<sup>c</sup> abruptly sets in seemingly deviates from the findings by Risse et al. [\\[33\\]](#page-6-8) on amorphous Mo3Si films, where a linear dependence of the resistance below T<sup>c</sup> on the frequency of the shaking field was reported, without any threshold frequency. We note, however, that while the maximum amplitude of the shaking field in our measurements, µ0hac ≈ 0.58 mT, was comparable to that used by Risse et al. (0.47 mT) [\\[33\\]](#page-6-8), the frequencies used in Ref. [\\[33\\]](#page-6-8) were usually between 100 kHz and 300 kHz, much higher than those used in our experiment (≤ 5 kHz, f = 1 kHz for most experiments). Therefore, a possible threshold frequency may have gone unnoticed in Ref. [\\[33\\]](#page-6-8), and/or the different material parameters and degree of disorder may play a certain role here.\n\nWe now want to compare our results with the estimates made in Ref. [\\[19\\]](#page-6-9) for the hac k H configuration. The vortex system can be equilibrated if the amplitude hac of a shaking field fulfills hac ≥ h <sup>∗</sup> = (1 − I/Ic)hp, with h<sup>p</sup> = jcb/2. For too small values of hac the shaking field cannot fully penetrate the sample, and parts of the sample remain unaffected by the ac magnetic field. Such an argument may explain the observation of a threshold value h ∗ for hac above which the peak effect can be observed in our R(T ) data. To make a quantitative comparison with the above prediction we assumed the validity of Bean's critical-state model, where j<sup>c</sup> is assumed to be spatially constant. We estimated I<sup>c</sup> ≈ 27 mA and j<sup>c</sup> ≈ 6.1 × 10<sup>4</sup> A/m<sup>2</sup> from a corresponding measurement of the current-voltage characteristics in µ0H = 3 T and at T = 15 K and using a voltage criterion V . 0.1 µV. With the sample width b ≈ 1.1 mm and the measuring current I = 5 mA, we obtain the condition µ0hac ≥ µ0h <sup>∗</sup> = 0.035 mT in µ0H = 3 T and at T = 15 K. This value is an order of magnitude smaller than our measured threshold value, µ0h <sup>∗</sup> ≈ 0.3 − 0.4 mT for an hac k H configuration as used in our experiment (see Figs. [7](#page-3-1) and [8\\)](#page-3-2).\n\nWe have used the relations from Ref. [\\[19\\]](#page-6-9) to estimate the time-averaged electric field Eav and the resulting resistance R = l Eav/I along the sample length l ≈ 3.3 mm. From Eav = I Ic 2bfµ0(hac − h ∗ ) for hac > h<sup>∗</sup> , with I = 5 mA and f = 1 kHz, we obtain R ≈ 130 µΩ for µ0H = 3 T and T = 15 K. The measured value R ≈ 30 µΩ is lower than this estimated value. In addition, considering the fact that corresponding measurements with f = 5 kHz give almost the same R values, we cannot confirm the predicted linear dependence of R on f in Ref. [\\[19\\]](#page-6-9).\n\nWe note that the effects of ac transport currents on the flux-line lattice can be similar to those of a superimposed shaking field produced by an ac coil as it has been shown by Gittleman and Rosenblum [\\[38](#page-6-14)] who used radio frequencies for their transport current, but without investigating the peak effect any further. Higgins and Bhattacharya [\\[5\\]](#page-5-5) measured the peak effect using an ac source for the transport current (I<sup>m</sup> ∼ 5 mA, unknown frequency) with a standard lock-in technique, but without the aid of a superimposed shaking field.\n\nIn our experiment, the square-wave excitation of the measuring current corresponds to a leading measuring frequency f<sup>1</sup> = 7.5 Hz, with rapidly decreasing amplitude of the higher harmonics. Using the total current I = 5 mA and applying Ampere's law (with the sample approximated by a cylinder of equal cross section A ≈ 0.44 mm<sup>2</sup> ), we obtain a self field at the sample surface of the order of 3 µT. Both the used measuring frequency and this self field are well below the here reported threshold values (500 Hz and 160 µT, respectively), above which the shaking has shown to become effective, and we therefore conclude that the influence of the measuring current is negligible when compared to that of the external main shaking field.\n\nWe finally want to point out that the technique of measuring R(T ) with an external continuously oscillating magnetic field may be more sensitive to explore the peak effect than inferring it from corresponding magnetization M(H) measurements alone, at least in some parts of the magnetic phase diagram of a sample. While the peakeffect feature is not discernible at temperatures higher than 15 K in the M(H) data shown in Figs. [2,](#page-1-1) the resistivity data (taken in combination with an ac magnetic field) reveal the peak-effect region also in this high-temperature region of the magnetic phase diagram. The absence of a corresponding signature in our resistivity data for magnetic fields larger than 3 T, however, can be explained with a strongly increasing j<sup>c</sup> with decreasing temperature, so that a condition similar to hac ≥ jcb/2 can no longer be fulfilled due to technical limitations for the amplitude hac. We expect, however, that larger shaking amplitudes hac do, in principle, allow to study the peak effect also in higher magnetic fields and at lower temperatures.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nWe have reported on the observation of the manifestation of the peak effect in resistivity data that is induced by the continuous application of an external oscillating magnetic field hac k H. No corresponding signature appears in the R(T ) data of the Nb3Sn crystal that were taken without such a shaking magnetic field.\n\nWe have studied the dependence of this effect on the transport current, the shaking frequency f, and the amplitude hac of the oscillating magnetic field. The amplitude hac that has been necessary to unveil the peak effect is an order of magnitude larger than what has been predicted to bring the vortex system to an equilibrium. These resistivity measurements, combined with a small oscillating magnetic field, allowed us to detect the signature of the peak effect also in the high-temperature part of the magnetic phase diagram of Nb3Sn where dc magnetization data were not accurate enough. Therefore we believe that such resistivity measurements, in combination with an oscillating magnetic field, may turn out to be a versatile tool not only for the investigation of the peak effect but also for studying other effects where the pinning of magnetic flux lines plays a certain role.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was supported by the Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur F¨orderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grants No. 20-111653 and No. 20-119793.\n\n- <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>∗ [reibelt@physik.uzh.ch](mailto:reibelt@physik.uzh.ch)\n- <span id=\"page-5-1\"></span>[1] G.

We investigated the dependence of this effect on the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field and show that the used technique can be more sensitive to detect the peak effect in a certain range of temperatures and magnetic fields than conventional magnetization measurements.",
