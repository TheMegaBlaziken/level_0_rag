Rev.* **89**, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, *T*c = 23 K, among these alloys. One of these alloys, Nb3Sn, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently Guo *et al* (*arXiv*:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of *T*c,zero = 81 K in La4H23 phase compressed at *P* = 118 GPa. Despite the La4H23 has much lower *T*c in comparison with near-room-temperature superconducting LaH10 phase (*T*c,zero = 250 K at *P* ~ 200 GPa) discovered by Drozdov *et al* (*Nature* **569**, 531 (2019)), the La4H23 holds the record high *T*c within A-15 family. Cross *et al* (*Phys. Rev. B* **109**, L020503 (2024)) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed La4H23. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in La4H23 and found that this superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 5.5 nm ≤ *D* ≤ 35 nm, low crystalline strain, |ε| ≤ 0.003, strong electron-phonon coupling interaction, 1.5 ≤ λeph≤ 2.55, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity, 0.18 ≤ Θ*D*/*T*<sup>F</sup> ≤ 0.22 (where Θ*D* is the Debye temperature, and *T*F is the Fermi temperature). We found that derived Θ*D*/*T*F and *T*c/*T*<sup>F</sup> values for the La4H23 phase are similar to the ones in MgB2, cuprates, pnictides, and nearroom-temperature superconductors H3S and LaH10.\n\n# **A-15 type superconducting hydride La4H23: Nanograined structure with low strain, strong electron-phonon interaction, and moderate level of nonadiabaticity**\n\n# **I. Introduction**\n\nIn 1953 Hardy and Hulm<sup>1</sup> discovered that A3B alloys (where A is one of the transition metals Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, and Mo, and B is one element of groups IIIB and IVB, or the precious metals Os, Ir, Pt, and Au<sup>2</sup> ) with A-15 lattice exhibit the superconducting transition temperature up to *T*c = 23 K (for Nb3Ge<sup>3</sup> ) and high values for low-temperature upper critical field, *B*c2(4.2 K) ~ 37 T (for Nb3Ge4 ). One of these alloys, Nb3Sn, is primary material for superconducting wires in nearly all modern commercial magnetic systems, including magnetic systems for mega-science projects5–37.\n\nPrimary physical reason why metallic hydrogen and hydrides are key materials in the quest of room temperature superconductivity can be understood based on two conclusions of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory38 of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity:\n\n$$1. \\quad T\\_{\\mathbb{C}} \\cong 1.17 \\times \\Theta\\_{\\mathbb{D}} \\times e^{-\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\_{\\mathbb{C}} - ph - \\mu^\\*}}\\tag{1}$$\n\n$$2. \\ T\\_c \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere Θ is the Debye temperature, ି is the dimensionless electron–phonon interaction constant, ∗ is reduced electron–electron interaction constant (the Coulomb pseudopotential), is the mass of the metallic ion. Despite strict theory of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity39,40 and its later development41–43 are complicated, simplified Eqs. 1,2 are very useful tool to understand primary physical idea for the quest44–46 of room-temperature superconductivity, where the desirable parameters of the superconductor are:\n\n- 1. high Debye temperature, Θ,\n- 2. strong electron-phonon interaction, ି ≥ 1.5, and ି ≫ ∗;\n- 3. as low as possible, the metal ion mass, .\n\nHypothetical metallic state of hydrogen47 would satisfy these conditions. However, it is extremely difficult to create a metallic state in hydrogen in experiment48–51. In addition, the analysis52 of available experimental data measured in the most metallized state of hydrogen53, showed that there is a possibility that this state exhibits strong nonadiabatic effects41–43. This implies that the observed *T*c in the experiment will be significantly suppressed from the value calculated by theoretical approach where the nonadiabatic effects were not counted.\n\nHowever, hypothetical possibility, that some alloys with high concentration of hydrogen (named superhydrides) can also exhibit mentioned above properties #1-#3, had been expressed years ago46,54.\n\nAfter nearly five decades of experimental quest48,49 of the *terra incognita* of room temperature superconductivity, Drozdov *et al*55 experimentally discovered the one in highly compressed H3S. To date, the highly compressed LaH10 holds record high *T*c (with *T*c,onset = 280 K56,57 at pressure *P* ~ 200 GPa) for ever known superconductors48,58. While the zero resistance and the Meissner effect in superhydrides had been registered already in the first report on H3S55, later these physical phenomena have been confirmed in LaH1057,59 and CeH9 60. The third fundamental phenomenon in the superconductors, which is the flux trap61– 63 effect, recently has discovered in H3S64, LaH1064 and CeH9 60.\n\nReturning now to the La-H binary system, we need to note that this system has a very rich phase diagram56,57,65,66. This was already shown in the first studies by Drozdov *et al*56. In the following extended study by Sakata *et al* 65 the multiphase feature of samples in the La-H system has been shown with a great clarity by reporting at least five fundamentally different XRD scans for La-H samples with the onset of transition temperature within a range of 65 ≤,௦௧ ≤ 112 . Later the crystalline structure for seven high-pressure LaxHy phases have been identified by Laniel *et al*66,\n\nRecently, Guo *et al*67 showed that there is a superhydride phase in La-H binary system, with a stoichiometry of La4H23. This phase exhibits A-15 (beta tungsten) arrangement of lanthanum ions43, and *T*c,zero = 81 K at pressure *P* = 118 GPa. Thus, A-15 superconductors' family can be extended by the high-temperature hydride superconductor La4H23. Despite the La4H23 has much lower *T*c in comparison with its near-room-temperature counterpart LaH10, the La4H23 holds the record high *T*c within A-15 family.\n\nSoon after the report by Guo *et al*67, Cross *et al*68 confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in highly compressed La4H23 phase with measured ,ோ→ <sup>ஐ</sup> ≅ 60 (*P* = 95 GPa), which was defined by strict resistive criterion:\n\n$$\\frac{|\\mathbb{R}(\\mathbb{T}) - \\mathbb{R}(\\mathbb{T}\\_{c, \\text{onset}})|}{\\mathbb{R}(\\mathbb{T}\\_{c, \\text{onset}})} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\tag{3}$$\n\nRecently two research groups69,70 specialized in the first-principles calculations of highpressure superconductors showed that the transition temperature of highly compressed superconductors should be affected by the crystalline lattice distortions (caused by either the presence of vacancies69, either by the anisotropic crystalline strain70). Considering that there is also a dependence of the Debye temperature, Θ, from the size of the crystals71, in this study we extracted the crystalline size, *D*, and the nanostrain, ε, in highly pressurized La4H23 superconductors from the XRD data reported by two research groups67,68. From our view, these parameters are additional characteristics which can enrich our understanding of the near-room-temperature superconductivity in superhydrides.\n\nThus, in this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in La4H23 by two research groups67,68, and we found that this superconducting phase exhibits:\n\n1. Nanograined structure, with average size of coherent-scattering regions, , varied in the range 5.5 ≤ ≤ 35 ;\n\n- 2. Low nanocrystalline strain, , which is varied in the range −0.003 ≤≤ 0.003 (where negative can be interpreted as the state with high concentrations of hydrogen vacancies);\n- 3. Relatively low Debye temperatures, Θሺ = 95 ሻ ≅ 500 , and Θሺ = 118 ሻ ≅ 860 , which implies that the La4H23 is strong coupled superconductor with high electron-phonon coupling constant 1.5 ≤ λି ≤ 2.55;\n- 4. Moderate level of the nonadiabaticity, 0.18 ≤ ವ ்ಷ ≤ 0.22 (where ி is the Fermi temperature).\n- 5. Deduced ratio of 0.020 ≤ ் ்ಷ ≤ 0.025 implies that the La4H23 phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.\n\n## **II. Experimental data sources and data analysis tool**\n\nPrimarily, we performed our analysis for experimental datasets provided by Cross *et al* <sup>68</sup> as free online experimental data source at the University of Bristol data center 68. *R*(*T*) dataset for report by Drozdov *et al*56 provided as Data Source for Ref.56. Data for Guo *et al*67 and Sakata *et al*65reports were digitized from original plots in the papers65,67. Each section describes the models and mathematical routines used for the analysis.

Results**\n\n## **3.1. Size-strain analysis**\n\nThere are no direct macroscopical techniques which can be applied to study the\n\nmicrostructure (at the submicron level) of the sample in the diamond anvil cell (DAC).\n\nHowever, primary structural parameters of the sample in DAC can be extracted from classical\n\nWilliamson-Hall (WH) analysis72 of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data.\n\nWe fitted XRD scans to multiple peaks Lorentz function73–75 (Figures S1,S2):\n\n$$I\\{2\\theta\\} = I\\_{background} + \\sum\\_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{2 \\times l\\_k}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{\\beta\\_k}{4 \\times \\left(2\\theta - 2\\theta\\_{peak,k}\\right)^2 + \\theta\\_k^2},\\tag{4}$$\n\nwhere is the peak area, 2, is the peak position, is peak integral breadth, and , 2,, and are-free fitting parameters. We manually adjusted the ௨ௗ level for each panel showed in all figures in this study.\n\nIn Figure S1 we showed the fit of the XRD data reported by Cross *et al*68 to Eq. 4, where we designated by thick red curves all peaks described by Cross *et al*68 as peaks of the La4H23 phase. One can see (Figure S1) that there are many peaks which were not designated to the La4H23 phase by Cross *et al*68. This is another confirmation of the findings by Sakata *et al*<sup>65</sup> and Laniel *et al*66, that there are several La-H phases which can simultaneously exist in the DAC sample. However, we should stress that as it showed by the first-principles calculations by Guo *et al* 67, high-temperature superconductivity with *T*c ~ 80 K is associated exclusively with the La4H23 phase at the pressure range of ~ 100 GPa.\n\nDerived dataset for the peak breadth, ሺሻ, and peak diffraction angle, ,, for the La4H23 phase was fitted to WH equation72 (where we assumed that the instrumental broadening, , is negligible):\n\n$$\\beta(\\theta, P) = \\frac{k\\_s \\times \\lambda\\_{X-ray}}{\\sigma(\\theta) \\times \\cos(\\theta)} + 4 \\times \\varepsilon(P) \\times \\tan(\\theta),\\tag{5}$$\n\nwhere ௦ is the Scherrer constant usually assigned as 0.975–78, ି௬ = 42.5 is the wavelength of the radiation used in Ref.68, and ି௬ = 41.24 is the wavelength of the radiation used in Ref.67, and ሺሻ is the mean size of coherent scattering regions, and the ሺሻ is the nanocrystalline strain.\n\nThe reason for the assumption that the instrumental broadening, , can be omitted in both experiments67,68 because it is small in comparison with the broadening originated from the sample is based on the following facts:\n\nThe assumption that the instrumental broadening, , can be omitted in both experiments67,68 because it is small in comparison with the broadening originated from the sample is based on the following facts:\n\n1. In synchrotron experiments (despite there are many experimental approaches and instrumental arrangements78–81) typical line broadening for the standardized samples and diffraction angles 2 ≲ 25° is 0.0025° ≤ ௪ ≤ 0.005°. This implies that the upper limit for the crystalline size, which can be determined from synchrotron XRD data, is ~ 2.0 μm<sup>79</sup> (this is in ~10 times larger than the upper size limit for the laboratory machines data73–77).\n\n2. Despite the XRD peaks in the high-pressure synchrotron experiments78,82–85 are broader in comparison with the ambient pressure experiments74,75,78–81, it should be noted, that it is difficult to ensure that at high-pressure conditions the sample remains the initial size of coherent scattering regions and the strain. Reported values for the resolution of the highpressure synchrotron experiments are within the range of 0.01° ≲ ≲ 0.04° for 2 ≲ 25°.\n\n3. Considering that both research groups67,68 did not report the instrumental broadening in their experiments, we can estimate this experimental characteristic in the following way. From reported XRD scan68 we choose three narrowest peaks (Figure S3), which are not the reflections of the La4H23 phase (for instance, the peak at 2 ≅ 7.640° has ௪ = 0.024° (Figure S3)). The fit of this ௪ሺ2ሻ dataset to Eq. 5 (Figure 1,a) shows that the crystalline size, associated with these reflections, is = 111 and the strain is = 3 × 10ିସ.\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1.** XRD peaks breadth, ሺሻ, for three narrowest peaks recorded by Cross *et al*68 and the data fit to (a) Williamson-Hall equation72 (Eq. 5); and (b) to Caglioti equation86 (Eq. 6). 95% confidence bands are shown by pink areas. Deduced parameters are shown. Fit quality is (a) 0.99999; and (b) 0.9987.\n\nBecause it is unlikely, that at harsh conditions of the La4H23 phase synthesis in the DAC67,68, some phase can exhibit conditions for perfect growth of large crystals, the revealed crystalline size = 111 should not be associated with the upper limit for the experimental resolution. Instead, it is the broadening where some part of it originates from the sample size/strain and another part is from the instrument. However, because we do not have another suitable dataset, we assumed that this dataset represents the upper limit, ,௨ሺ2ሻ, for the instrumental broadening for Cross *et al*68 experiment.\n\nWe can use this dataset to estimate parameters in the Caglioti equation86:\n\n$$\\beta\\_{l,upper}(2\\theta) = \\sqrt{U \\times \\tan^2\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{2}\\right) + V \\times \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{2}\\right) + W} \\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere , , and are free-fitting parameters. Both research groups67,68 conducted experiments for 2 ≤ 22° and, because of the limited number of data points (only three), we omitted the term of × ଶሺ2ሻ. Result of the fit is shown in Figure 1(b), where deduced and parameters are shown. In Figure 2(a-c) we showed the extracted ௪ሺ, = 95 ሻ data for the La4H23 phase. In Figure 2 (d-f) we showed corrected peaks breadth by the equation:\n\n$$\\beta(\\theta, P = 95 \\, GPa) = \\beta\\_{\\text{raw}} \\, \\text{(2}\\theta, P = 95 \\, GPa) - \\beta\\_{l, \\text{upper}} \\, \\text{(2}\\theta, P = 95 \\, GPa) \\tag{7}$$\n\nIn Figure 2 we fitted data to the Williamson-Hall equation (Eq. 5).\n\nFigure 2 shows that deduced ሺ = 95 ሻ~30 , and the strain is low ሺ = 95 ሻ ≤ 0.005. One can see that when fits performed for the condition when both parameters are free (Figure 2(a,d)), then 2 uncertainties for both parameters are large. Based on that in Figures 2(b,e) we restricted fits to reveal the minimum size of the nanocrystals, 14 ≤ ሺ = 95 ሻ ≤ 17 (by applying the condition of ሺ = 95 ሻ ≡ 0).\n![](0__page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 2.** XRD peaks breadth (a-c) ௪ሺሻ and (d-f) ሺሻ = ௪ሺሻ − ,௨ሺሻ data and data fits to the Williamson-Hall equation72 (Eq. 5) for highly compressed single crystal La4H23 (*P* = 95 GPa).

In overall (Figure 2), our analysis showed that the nanocrystalline strain in the La4H23 phase at = 95 is low, because its maximum possible value of ௫ሺ = 95 ሻ = 0.005 ± 0.001 is approximately equal to the value determine by the same WH technique in high-quality epitaxial undoped YBa2Cu3O7-δ films87.\n\nIn the similar way, we analyzed XRD data reported by Guo *et al*67. In Figure 3 we showed the WH analysis for the La4H23 ሺ118 ሻ sample, where we showed all peaks which we deduced from the experimental scan (Figure S2). Figure 3 shows data fit to Eq. 5, where in panels (a,c) one can see a negative value for the crystalline strain ሺ118 ሻ = −0.003 ± 0.003.\n\n![](0__page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3.** XRD peaks breadth (a,b) ௪ሺሻ and (c,d) ሺሻ = ௪ሺሻ − ,௨ሺሻ data and data fits to the Williamson-Hall equation72 (Eq. 5) for highly compressed single crystal La4H23 (*P* = 118 GPa).

Considering that the 2σ uncertainty for value is the same as the value itself, we concluded that the sample synthesised and studied by Guo *et al* 67 has very low or no nanostrain.\n\nFigure 3 also shows that the instrumental broadening, ሺሻ, for synchrotron\n\nexperiments67, for sample with crystalline size of = 6 can be completely omitted.\n\nBy omitting the stain contribution in the broadening, we can determine the grain size, ሺ118 ሻ = 7 , with better accuracy by performing the fit at the condition of ≡ 0 (Fig. 3 b,d). Considering that the lattice parameter ሺ118 ሻ = 0.614 , we can conclude that this sample has a nanogranular structure ሺ118 ሻ ≅ 11 × .\n\n68In overall, we found that synthesized La4H23 samples by both research groups have nanograin structure with average grain size in the range of 5.5 ≲ ≤ 35 and low nanocrystalline strain || ≤ 0.003.\n\n## **3.2. Debye temperature**\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Debye temperature, Θ, is one of primary parameters in the theory of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity38. *De facto* the standard technique to determine the Debye temperature, Θ, for samples in DAC89–91 is the fit of the normal part of the temperature dependent resistance, ሺሻ, to the saturated resistance model92–94 (where the Θ is a free-fitting parameter):\n\n$$\\rho(T) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\rho\\_{\\rm sat}} + \\frac{1}{\\rho\\_{\\rm Debye}(T)}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\rho\\_{\\rm sat}} + \\frac{1}{\\left(\\rho\\_0 + \\rho\\_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{\\Theta\\_D}\\right)^5 \\times \\int\\_0^T \\frac{\\mathbf{x}^5}{\\left(e^{\\mathbf{x}} - 1\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-\\mathbf{x}}\\right)^{\\rm{d}T}}}\\right)}}\\tag{8}$$\n\nwhere ௦௧, , , and are free-fitting parameters.\n\nRecently Watanabe *et al* 95 reported a good agreement between the Θ deduced from the fit of the ሺሻ data to the Eq. 8 and from the fit of the low-temperature normal state specific heat capacity, ሺሻ, in the η-carbide-type oxide Zr4Pd2O. In the latter technique, the ሺሻ is fitted to the equation:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\_p(T) = \\chi \\times T + \\beta \\times T^3 + \\delta \\times T^5 \\tag{9}$$\n\nwhere is the Sommerfeld coefficient, *β* and *δ* are the amplitudes of the phonon contributions for the harmonic and anharmonic terms, respectively; and the Θ is calculated by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Theta\\_D = \\left(\\frac{12\\pi^4 N R\\_{g\\varepsilon}}{5\\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\tag{10}\n$$\n\nwhere is the number of atoms per formula unit and = 8.31 ିଵିଵ is the universal gas constant. It is important to noted that the approach expressed by Eqs. 9-10 is the standard way to determine the Debye temperature from the total specific heat data 95–102.\n\nAdvanced approach 103–105 is to fit the ሺሻ data to the Debye equation:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\_p(T) = \\chi \\times T + 9 \\times R\\_{gc} \\times N \\times \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\Theta\\_\\mathsf{D}}\\right)^3 \\int\\_0^{\\Theta\\_\\mathsf{D}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} dx \\tag{11}$$\n\nwhere all parameters defined above, or to multichannel Debye-Einstein equation:\n\n$$\\mathcal{C}\\_{p}(T) = \\chi \\times T + 9 \\times R\\_{g\\varepsilon} \\times \\sum\\_{l=1}^{M} A\\_{l} \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\theta\\_{B,l}}\\right)^{3} \\int\\_{0}^{\\Theta\\_{B,l}} \\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}} dx + 3 \\times R\\_{g\\varepsilon} \\times \\sum\\_{j=1}^{p} B\\_{j} \\left(\\frac{\\Theta\\_{E,j}}{\\tau}\\right)^{2} \\frac{e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Theta\\_{E,j}}{\\tau}\\right)^{2}}}{\\left(e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Theta\\_{E,j}}{\\tau}\\right)^{2}} - 1\\right)^{2}} \\tag{12}$$\n\nwhere and are constants (depended from given crystalline structure and chemical composition), and are number of the channels for the Debye modes and the Einstein modes, respectively; Θ, is the Debye temperature of the *i*-channel, Θா, is the Einstein temperature of the *j*-channel. The use of the Eq. 11 requires high sensitivity measurements of the ሺሻ and an addition, all measurements should be performed in a wide temperature range, 0 < ≲Θா, with a small temperature step, Δ<sup>~</sup> ವ ହ, between measurements, at least at low-*T* region of normal state 106.\n\nBecause DAC has significantly larger thermal mass in comparison with the mass of the sample, this is practically impossible to extract the contribution of the sample in the total ሺሻ from experimental measurements of the total heat capacity. Thus, to extract the Debye temperature for samples in DAC, temperature dependent resistive measurements are fitted to the Eq. 8.\n\nTo answer a possible question about the comparison of the deduced Θ values extracted from the fit of the ሺሻ data to Eq. 11 and from the fit of the ሺሻ data to Eq. 8, in Figure 4 we showed the ሺሻ and ሺሻ data fits for the cubic centrosymmetric η-carbide Nb4Rh2C1 –<sup>δ</sup> (raw datasets were reported by Ma *et al*107). Deduced Θ = ሺ290 ± 2ሻ (from ሺሻ data) and Θ = ሺ312 ± 3ሻ (from ሺሻ data) are evidences that both methods (i.e. Eqs. 8,11) can be used to extract the Debye temperature from experimental data. For clarity, in Figure 4,c we showed two components of the ሺሻ data fit, ௦௧ and ௬ሺሻ.\n\nIn Figure 5 we showed the ሺ, = 98 ሻ curves68 for compressed La4Hi23 and data fits to Eq. 8. Derived Debye temperature, 445 K ≤ Θ ≤ 583 , is significantly lower than the values of 1310 K ≤ Θ ≤ 1675 determined for the LaH10 phase, which has > 200 91.\n\nSurprisingly enough, we found that the sample designated by Drozdov *et al*56 as LaHx>3 (compressed at pressure = 150 and it has a designation of Sample 1156) exhibits very close Debye temperature Θ = 655 ± 2 and ,.ହ = 66.2 (Figure 6). This dataset was also analysed in Ref.91.\n\n![](0__page_14_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 4.** (a) Temperature dependent heat capacity, ሺሻ, and data fit to Eq. 11 for cubic centrosymmetric η-carbide Nb4Rh2C1 –δ (raw data reported by Ma *et al*107).

The deduced value is practically undistinguishable from the Θ values deduced for four samples of the La4H23 phase synthesized by Cross *et al*68 (Figure 5).\n\nThe fit of the reported *R*(*T*) data measured in the La4H23 ሺ114 ሻ (data reported by Guo *et al*67) is shown in Figure 8.

The electron phonon coupling constant**\n\nFrom deduced Θ and ,.ହ, which we defined by the criterion:\n\n$$\\frac{|\\mathbb{R}(T) - \\mathbb{R}\\{\\mathbb{T}\\_{c, \\text{ones}}\\}|}{\\mathbb{R}\\{\\mathbb{T}\\_{c, \\text{ones}}\\}} = \\mathbf{0}.05,\\tag{13}$$\n\nthe electron-phonon coupling constant, ି, can be determined as the root of advanced\n\nMcMillan equation91:\n\n$$T\\_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.45}\\right) \\times \\Theta\\_D \\times e^{-\\left(\\frac{1.04\\left(1+\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}-\\mu^\\*\\left(1+0.62\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}\\right)} \\times f\\_1 \\times f\\_2^\\*,\\tag{14}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$f\\_1 = \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}}{2.46(1+3.8\\mu^\\*)}\\right)^{3/2}\\right)^{1/3},\\tag{15}$$\n\n$$f\\_2^\\* = 1 + (0.0241 - 0.0735 \\times \\mu^\\*) \\times \\lambda\\_{e-ph}^2,\\tag{16}$$\nwhere ∗ is the Coulomb pseudopotential. In this work, we fixed <sup>∗</sup> ≡ 0.13, because this is a typical value for highly compressed electron-phonon mediated superconductors108–110. (It can be mentioned that Eqs. 14-16 are more complicated in comparison with Eq. 1, however, these equations remain primary dependences ∝ Θ × ି <sup>భ</sup> ഊష).\n\nDerived ି values for the LaHx samples are shown in Figs. 4-8, where in Figure 7, the transition temperature was assumed to be at the inflection point of the ሺሻ curve.\n\n### **3.4. The ground state coherence length**\n\nTo deduced the ground state coherence length, ሺ0ሻ, which is one of two fundamental lengths in any superconductor, we fitted the data for upper critical field, ଶሺሻ, to the equation proposed by Baumgartner *et al*111:\n\n$$B\\_{c2}(T) = \\frac{1}{0.693} \\times \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{2\\pi\\xi^2(0)} \\times \\left( \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau\\_c} \\right) - 0.153 \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau\\_c} \\right)^2 - 0.152 \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau\\_c} \\right)^4 \\right) \\tag{17}$$\n\nWhere <sup>=</sup> ଶ is the superconducting flux quantum, <sup>ℎ</sup> = 6.626 × 10ିଷସ ⋅ is Planck constant, = 1.602 × 10ିଵଽ , and ሺ0ሻ, and ≡ ,.ହሺ = 0ሻ are free fitting parameters.\n\nWe extracted raw ଶሺሻ datasets from the ሺ,ሻ datasets by the criterion described by Eq. 13. In Fig. 9 we showed the ଶሺሻ data and data fits to Eq. 17, from which the derived ሺ2.1 ± 0.1ሻ ≤ ሺ0ሻ ≤ ሺ3.0 ± 0.1ሻ . <sup>68</sup>\n\n![](1__page_19_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 9.** The upper critical field data, *B*c2(*T*), for compressed La4H23 and data fits to Eq. 17. Raw *R*(*T*) data reported by (a) Cross *et al*68and (b) Guo *et al*67. Pink area shows 95% confidence band.\n\n# **3.5. The Fermi temperature**\n\nTo calculate the Fermi temperature, we used the equation112,113:\n\n$$T\\_F = \\frac{\\pi^2 m\\_e}{8 \\cdot k\\_B} \\times \\left\\{ 1 + \\lambda\\_{e-ph} \\right\\} \\times \\xi^2(0) \\times \\left( \\frac{a \\times k\\_B \\times T\\_c}{\\hbar} \\right)^2,\\tag{18}$$\n\nwhere = 9.109 × 10ିଷଵ is bare electron mass, ℏ = 1.055 × 10ିଷସ ⋅ is reduced Planck constant, = 1.381 × 10ିଶଷ <sup>ଶ</sup> ⋅ ⋅ ିଶ ⋅ ିଵ is Boltzmann constant, ≡ ଶ×ሺሻ ಳ×் is the gap-to-transition temperature ratio, where Δሺ0ሻ is the ground state amplitude of the superconducting gap.\n\nIn Sections 3.2.-3.4. we determined all terms in the Eq. 18, except the ≡ ଶ×ሺሻ ಳ×் value. The linear empirical relation proposed in Ref.114 can estimate this value:\n\n$$\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{2\\Delta(0)}{\\kappa\\_{\\text{B}} \\cdot T\\_{\\text{C}}} = 3.26 + 0.74 \\times \\lambda\\_{\\text{e-ph}} \\tag{19}$$\n\nConsidering that the free-fitting value of ,.ହሺ95 ሻ = 77 in Figure 9,a is close to the observed ,.ହሺ95 ሻ = 78.2 ± 0.1 value in Figure 5,d, we substituted the derived ି = 2.30 for this sample (i.e. Fig. 5,d) in the Eq. 19, and calculated రுమయ = 4.96.In the result, we estimated the ிሺ95 ሻ = 3.06 × 10<sup>ଷ</sup> in the La4H23 ( = 95 ). It should be noted that our calculated the Fermi velocity, ிሺ95 ሻ = 1.68 × 10<sup>ହ</sup> <sup>௦</sup> , is in remarkable agreement with the value ிሺ95 ሻ = 1.80 × 10<sup>ହ</sup> <sup>௦</sup> reported by Cross *et al*68.\n\nFor sample<sup>67</sup> ,.ହሺ114 ሻ = 81 (Figure 9,b), ିሺ114 ሻ = 1.52 (Figure 8), from which calculated రுమయ = 4.38, and ிሺ114 ሻ = 3.99 × 10<sup>ଷ</sup> .\n\n### **3.6. Identification plots**\n\nUtilizing deduced parameters, we found that the La4H23 phase falls to the unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot (Figure 10), and it locates near cuprates and another superhydride LaBeH8 (*P* = 120 GPa).\n\nWe also deduced the ratios of ವ ்ಷ ሺ95 ሻ = 0.176 and ವ ்ಷ ሺ114 ሻ = 0.216 for the La4H23 phase. This value is used to locate this phase in the ವ ்ಷ vs ି diagram (Figure 11) (this type of diagram proposed by Pietronero *et al* 42,43,115,116).\n\n![](1__page_21_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 10.** Uemura plot where the highly compressed ସଶଷ phase is shown together with the main families of superconductors: metals, iron-based superconductors, diborides, cuprates, Laves phases, and near-room-temperature superconducting.

The advantage of this type of plot is that it links three primary thermodynamic quantities in superconductors, which are average energies per particles in the superconductor: the Cooper pairs, electrons, and atomic ions, while the Uemura plot (Figure 10) and the Pietronero plot (Figure 11) link only two characteristic energies per particles in superconductors. All values (and references, for each value) showed in Figures 10-12 are given in Refs. 117,119,121.\n\n![](1__page_22_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 12.** The ವ ்ಷ vs plot (this type of plot was proposed in Ref. 117,121) for several families of superconductors and highly compressed ସଶଷ. References are given in 43,52,89,112,113,115,117–124.\n\n# **IV. Discussion**\n\nOne can see in Figure 12, that all superconductors with <sup>≥</sup> <sup>20</sup> exhibit the ವ ்ಷ ratio within a narrow range, 0.04 ≤ ವ ்ಷ ≤ 0.4. This is perhaps the most interesting finding of this study, because the La4H23 phase falls into this narrow band. While Pietronero and coworkers 41–43,115,116,125 prefer to use the value of ି × ವ ்ಷ , as it showed in their Figure 11 43, the use of the ವ ்ಷ ratio, without additional multiplication term ି, is also useful, because it utilizes only three fundamental temperatures of any conductor, and it does not use any multiplicative factor associated with any pairing mechanism (for instance, the electronphonon coupling strength, for the electron-phonon mediated mechanism).\n\nDespite there is no theoretical explanation for this (Figure 12) new empirical fact 117,121, the primary physics behind this observation is more likely related to the issue that high superconducting transition temperature, *T*c, emerges in materials where the highest energy of the charge carriers exceeds, but not overwhelming, the energy of the coherent oscillations of the crystalline lattice. At this condition (if even in some materials the pairing of the Cooper pairs originates from different from the electron-phonon mechanism, for instance, in cuprates), the Cooper pairs are not disturbed by either very energetic coherent lattice oscillations (in cases of ி ≪ Θ), or by uncorrelated random thermodynamic local distortions/fluctuations, which exist at high temperature in materials with low Debye temperature, Θ ≪ ி.\n\nBased on this picture, we can describe the physics behind the Uemura plot 122,123,126, as an alternative presentation of the same physical picture, where however, the third fundamental temperature of any superconductor, i.e. the Debye temperature, is missed.\n\nEmpirical finding 89,90,112,113,117,118,121,127–129 that all highly compressed superhydrides fall to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot (despite all these superconductors exhibit the electron-phonon pairing mechanism) and which was interpreted 89,90,112,113,117,118,121,127–129 as the evidence for the unconventional pairing mechanism in the superhydrides, in fact reveals the issue that the ವ ்ಷ ratio for all high-temperature superconductors, <sup>≥</sup> <sup>20</sup>, falls to a narrow range of 0.04 <sup>≤</sup> ವ ≤ 0.4.\n\n்ಷ\n\nFollowing recent theoretical understanding of the physics in superhydrides and other high-temperature superconductors43 we can characterize all superhydrides by:\n\n- 1. highest Debye phonon frequency, ≥ 50 , among all superconducting materials;\n- 2. high electron phonon coupling constant, ି ≥ 1.5;\n- 3. reasonably high, but not record high, Fermi temperature, 2,000 ≤ி ≤ 30,000 ;\n- 4. significant quantum lattice fluctuations 130–133, due to high frequency for the lattice oscillations associated with the lightest chemical element;\n- 5. the presence of a Van Hove singularity close to the Fermi level;\n- 6. moderate level of the nonadiabaticity, 0.05 ≤ ି × ்ವ ்ಷ ≤ 1.0;\n- 7. reasonably high ் ்ಷ ratio, 0.005 ≤ ் ்ಷ ≤ 0.04, which implies that in the Uemura plot all superhydrides fall to unconventional superconductors band.\n\nAs one can see from #1-#7 above, all electron-phonon mediated hydride superconductors have many properties which are similar or identical to cuprates and pnictides. Thus, from this point of view, all superhydrides can be classified as unconventional superconductors 43,90,112,113,118,128, despite a fact that these superconductors exhibit electron-phonon pairing mechanism (which is clearly demonstrated by prominent isotope effect in direct experiments 55,56).\n\nThis paradoxical understanding is clearly expressed and explained by Cappelluti *et al*<sup>43</sup> now, while Luciano Pietronero presented this theoretical concept at the conference in May 2017134. In peer-review form112,113 (see also135) and independently this paradox was first reported as empirical finding derived from the experimental data analysis for the temperature dependent upper critical field in highly compressed H3S and LaH10.\n\nFrom our point of view, all mentioned above properties for high- and near-roomtemperature superconductors (including cuprates, pnictides, diborides, and hydrides) can be summarized in the empirical finding condition, where three fundamental temperatures of any superconductor are obeying the strict condition117,121:\n\n$$T\\_c \\ge 20\\text{ K} \\implies 0.04 \\le \\frac{\\theta\\_0}{T\\_F} \\le 0.4\\tag{20}$$\n\nEq. 20 represents a problem which needs to be explained (graphical representation of Eq. 20 is given in Figure 12). It should be also noted that this understanding/explanation might lie beyond the conventional first-principles calculation studies which is the dominant theoretical approach utilized in modern high-pressure superconductivity 50,67,108,130,136–161 and global view on high-pressure superconductivity, where will be presented hydrides48–50,55,56,59,60,64– 67,70,115,118,127,129–134,136,138–144,147,149,151,152,154–158,160–207, other high-pressure superconductors90,119,120,208–236 and ambient pressure superconductors62,95,99,237–273, including amorphous274–276 and quasicrystals277–282 would be considered from the unified theoretical concept.\n\n### **V. Conclusions**\n\nIn this work, we analyzed experimental data reported for highly compressed hightemperature superconducting La4H23 phase. This phase is a new A-15-type phase which simultaneously extends the family of highly pressurized hydrides, the family of A-15 superconductors, and the family of high-pressure superconductors.\n\nWe found a good agreement between derived Debye temperature Θ*D* for the La4H23 phase and the Θ*D* deduced for two samples with similar values of *T*c ~ 70 K a phase reported by Drozdov *et al* 56 as the unknown phase with an approximate stoichiometry of LaHx (x>3) and by Sakata *et al* 65, who designated the sample stoichiometry as the LaHx (x<10). From this,\n\nwe proposed that *de facto* the La4H23 phase was first discovered in the experiment by Drozdov *et al* 56 and by Sakata *et al* 65.\n\nWe also found that the La4H23 phase synthesised and studied by both research groups 67,68 has nanoscale grain size and is very low, or even the absence, of the crystalline strain.\n\nIn addition, we also deduced the values:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}(1) \\ 0.020 \\le \\frac{T\\_c}{T\\_F} \\le 0.025; \\\\\\\\ (2) \\ 0.18 \\le \\frac{\\Theta\\_D}{T\\_F} \\le 0.22; \\\\\\\\ (3) \\ 1.5 \\le \\lambda\\_{e-ph} \\le 2.55. \\end{aligned}$$\n\n# **Data availability statement**\n\nThe data that supports the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n# **Declaration of interests**\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal\n\nrelationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n### **References**\n\n1.

        "abstract": "For seven decades, when referring to A-15 superconductors, we meant metallic A<SUB>3</SUB>B alloys (where A is a transition metal, and B is group IIIB and IVB elements) discovered by Hardy and Hulm (1953 Phys. Rev. 89 884). Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, T<SUB>c</SUB> = 23K, among these alloys. One of these alloys, Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn, is the primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently, Guo et al (2024 Natl Sci. Rev. nwae149, https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae149) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions are arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of T<SUB>c</SUB><SUB>,zero</SUB> = 81K in the La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB> phase compressed at P = 118 GPa. Despite the fact that La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB> has much lower T<SUB>c</SUB> in comparison with the near-room-temperature superconducting LaH<SUB>10</SUB> phase (T<SUB>c</SUB><SUB>,zero</SUB> = 250K at P ∼ 200 GPa) discovered by Drozdov et al (2019 Nature 569 531), La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB> holds the record for the highest T<SUB>c</SUB> within the A-15 family. Cross et al (2024 Phys. Rev. B 109 L020503) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in compressed La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB>. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB> and found that this superconductor exhibits a nanograined structure, 5.5 nm ⩽ D ⩽ 35 nm, low crystalline strain, [ image ] ⩽ 0.003, strong electron-phonon interaction, 1.5 ⩽ λ<SUB>e-ph</SUB>⩽ 2.55, and a moderate level of nonadiabaticity, 0.18 ⩽ Θ<SUB>D</SUB>/T<SUB>F</SUB> ⩽ 0.22 (where Θ<SUB>D</SUB> is the Debye temperature, and T<SUB>F</SUB> is the Fermi temperature). We found that the derived Θ<SUB>D</SUB>/T<SUB>F</SUB> and T<SUB>c</SUB>/T<SUB>F</SUB> values for the La<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>23</SUB> phase are similar to those in MgB<SUB>2</SUB>, cuprates, pnictides, and the near-room-temperature superconductors H<SUB>3</SUB>S and LaH<SUB>10</SUB>.
