Hydrogen cage structures have been identified as a common motif beneficial for high critical temperatures Tc. Efforts are now focused on finding hydride high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures. We present evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in binary La4H<sup>23</sup> with A15 type structure featuring hydrogen cages at a pressure of P = 95 GPa. We synthesise La4H<sup>23</sup> from a lanthanum film capped with a palladium catalyst promoting the dissociation of hydrogen. In resistance measurements, we observe superconductivity with a transition temperature T<sup>c</sup> ∼ 90 K. In X-ray diffraction on the same sample, we identify the A15-type cubic body centred structure of the lanthanum sublattice. From comparison with earlier XRD and structure prediction studies, we identify this phase with La4H23. Our study reinforces the concept of hydrogen cages for high-temperature superconductivity.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-temperature superconductivity up to ∼ 250 K has been reported and independently confirmed in LaH<sup>10</sup> at pressures ∼ 180 GPa [\\[1,](#page-10-0) [2\\]](#page-10-1). In LaH<sup>10</sup> and other hydride high-temperature superconductors, clathrate-like cages of hydrogen atoms have been identified as a common structural motif [\\[3,](#page-10-2) [4\\]](#page-10-3). Recent efforts have been devoted to finding high-temperature superconducting phases at lower pressures [\\[4\\]](#page-10-3). Notably, the cubic Fm¯3m phase of the LaH<sup>10</sup> system could be stabilised at moderate pressures around 110 GPa in compounds synthesised from an alloy of cerium and lanthanum [\\[5\\]](#page-10-4). Recent XRD studies found new structures in the binary lanthanum hydride system that feature hydrogen cages and hence are strong candidates for superconductivity [\\[6\\]](#page-10-5).\n\nThe A15-type structure (space group Pm¯3n) is expected to be favourable for superconductivity as it promotes clathrate cages of hydrogen atoms around the body-centred cubic lattice of the metal atoms as illustrated in the inset of [Figure 1](#page-4-0) (c). In this struc-\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span><span id=\"page-1-0\"></span><sup>∗</sup> [sc16434@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sc16434@bristol.ac.uk)\n\n<sup>†</sup> [sven.friedemann@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sven.friedemann@bristol.ac.uk)\n\nture, hydrogen atoms feature bond lengths in the range ≈ 1.1 ˚A to 1.3 ˚A favourable for high-temperature superconductivity. This bond length is much larger than in hydrogen molecules at this pressure and indicates a weaker bond compared to molecular bonding. Through the donation of electrons from the metal atoms, the hydrogen anitbonding bands can be populated leading to stabilisation of the hydrogen cages and providing an avenue for metallisation and superconductivity [\\[7\\]](#page-11-0). The weakening of the H-H bond and the formation of cages is required for hydrogen to contribute electronic states at the Fermi energy and hence for significant electron-phonon coupling involving the hydrogen atoms required for high-temperature superconductivity.\n\nHydride compounds of the A15-type structure have been searched for superconductivity in computational studies, e.g., leading to the prediction of high-temperature superconductivity in LiNi3H<sup>23</sup> [\\[8\\]](#page-11-1). Recently, superconductivity was indeed discovered in members of this structure type, in Lu4H<sup>23</sup> at pressures above 200 GPa [\\[9\\]](#page-11-2). Furthermore, the structure type has also been detected in X-ray diffraction studies of Ba4H23, Eu4H23, and La4H<sup>23</sup> [\\[6,](#page-10-5) [10,](#page-11-3) [11\\]](#page-11-4). Hence, there is a strong interest to probe experimentally for superconductivity in these members of the A15 structure type.\n\nThe A15-type structure has recently been detected in the lanthanum hydride binary system with single-crystal XRD by Laniel et al. at pressures between 96 GPa to 150 GPa [\\[6\\]](#page-10-5). Laniel et al. synthesised La4H<sup>23</sup> by laser heating bulk lanthanum with paraffin oil as a hydrogen donor material. During the preparation of this manuscript, Guo et al. reported synthesis of La4H<sup>23</sup> from bulk LaH<sup>3</sup> and ammonia borane (NH3BH3). Furthermore, Guo et al. detected superconductivity in their samples of La4H<sup>23</sup> in resistance measurements. Here, we present synthesis of La4H<sup>23</sup> from a thin film of lanthanum capped with palladium and using NH3BH<sup>3</sup> as a hydrogen donor [\\[12,](#page-11-5) [13\\]](#page-11-6). Upon laser heating, molecular hydrogen is dissociated by the palladium and diffuses into the lanthanum forming La4H23. We detect the formation of La4H<sup>23</sup> with XRD measurements and superconductivity through four-point resistance measurements including the characteristic suppression in magnetic fields up to 12 T.\n\n# II. SYNTHESIS OF LA4H<sup>23</sup>\n\nThe successful synthesis of La4H<sup>23</sup> is evident from our X-ray diffraction in [Figure 1.](#page-4-0) We observe characteristic reflections between 7.5 ◦ ≤ 2θ ≤ 10◦ and 13.5 ◦ ≤ 2θ ≤ 16◦ that are best assigned to the La4H<sup>23</sup> phase. Besides the La4H23, we also observe peaks from elemental lanthanum (orthorombically distorted Fmmm) and gold (Fm¯3m). The former is residue from the synthesis of La4H<sup>23</sup> whilst the latter originates from the electrodes used for our resistance measurements. We can rule out several other phases including I4/mmm LaH<sup>4</sup> [\\(Figure E1\\)](#page-4-0), P63/mmc LaH<sup>9</sup> [\\(Figure E2\\)](#page-5-0) and C2/m LaH<sup>x</sup> [\\(Figure E3\\)](#page-8-0) that have been reported for the La-H binary system as detailed in the extended data. We can also rule out the formation of Fm¯3m LaBH<sup>8</sup> [\\(Figure E4\\)](#page-14-0) as well as the carbohydride impurity P63/mmc LaCH<sup>2</sup> reported by Laniel et al. at 96 GPa [\\(Figure E5\\)](#page-15-0) [\\[6\\]](#page-10-5).\n\nThe XRD data reveal a homogeneous sample without texture. This is visible from both the azimuthal representation of the detector image in [Figure 1\\(](#page-4-0)b) as well as the analysis of the angle-integrated XRD pattern. The detector image shows continuous vertical lines without significant spots indicating a large ensemble of grains in a polycrystalline sample. At the same time, the angle-integrated XRD pattern exhibits peak intensities as expected for a powder average [\\(Figure 1](#page-4-0) (a)). Indeed, we are able to fit the observed XRD pattern with a Rietveld refinement without any preferential orientation, only invoking strain to reproduce the peak broadening.\n\nThe lattice constants extracted from Rietveld refinement provide confidence in the assignment of the La4H<sup>23</sup> phase with A15-type La sublattice and suggest a large hydrogen content close to the stoichiometric ratio La:H = 1:5.75 for the La4H<sup>23</sup> phase. The lattice parameters (a = 6.191(4) ˚A, volume per La atom = 29.66(8) ˚A 3 ) are in good agreement with previous reports and close to the predicted equation of state (EoS) (see [Figure 1\\(](#page-4-0)c)) [\\[6\\]](#page-10-5). The comparison with the EoS suggests a stoichiometric La4H<sup>23</sup> composition. However, some uncertainty remains for this indirect method of determining the hydrogen content as pointed out by Laniel et al. [\\[6\\]](#page-10-5). In particular, we cannot exclude vacancies on the hydrogen lattice and have limited resolution to detect the subtle modifications of the metal sublattice that might be associated with hydrogen vacancies and superstructures [\\[10\\]](#page-11-3).\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG. 1.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN LA4H<sup>23</sup>\n\nThe resistance measurements presented in [Figure 2](#page-5-0) provide evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in La4H23. Immediately after laser heating, we observe a pronounced drop\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>FIG. 2. Detection of superconductivity in La4H23and resistance measurements on subsequent cooling runs. In each case, cooling and warming measurements are indicated. The value of T<sup>c</sup> was determined at the onset of superconductivity from the intersection of linear fits to the normal and superconducting states, shown by the dashed line in the third thermal cycle. Cooldown and warmup 1 and 2 were collected shortly after laser heating. Cooldown and warmup 3 were recorded after the XRD measurements.\n\nin the resistance with an onset at T<sup>c</sup> = 86 K and reaching zero resistance within the resolution |R − Rn|/R<sup>n</sup> ≤ 1 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> of our experiment below 60 K, where R<sup>n</sup> is the resistance of the normal state. We have repeated resistance measurements several times including before and after XRD measurements and find the superconductivity to be stable with a slight increase to T<sup>c</sup> = 95 K between subsequent measurements. We attribute this increase to annealing of the sample at room temperature similar to reports on H3S [\\[16\\]](#page-12-0).\n\nThe normal state resistance shows indications of phase instabilities with decomposition exhibiting activated behaviour. If warming the sample above 250 K, the sample resistance increases over time as illustrated in [Figure 2.](#page-5-0) This manifests as an initial increase during cooldowns and further increase during warm-up. Only below 250 K, cool-down and warmup agree where we observe metallic behaviour in the sample immediately after laser heating (thermal cycles 1 and 2).\n\nThe changes to the sample also induce fundamental change from metallic to non-metallic over time. Over multiple warm-ups to above 250 K, the resistance changes from metallic (dR/dT > 0) to non-metallic (dR/dT < 0). A similar change from metallic to non-metallic has been observed by Guo et al. after the first laser heating and in subsequent decompression\n\nruns. In our study, the pressure before and after laser heating remained stable within our uncertainty of ± 5 GPa, therefore the change in the normal state could originate from either small changes in pressure and/or could be time dependent. Equally, the broadening of the superconducting transition and the loss of zero resistance reported by Guo et al. below 100 GPa may be related to sample decomposition.\n\nThe combination of increasing resistance and change to non-metallic behaviour suggests that part of the sample slowly transforms to a semimetallic or insulating material. In our sample, we have detected La4H<sup>23</sup> and elemental La with XRD, both of which may form part of the electrical path sampled by our resistance measurements with La4H<sup>23</sup> providing at least a percolative path supporting zero resistance of the high-T<sup>c</sup> state. Hence, the increase in resistance with time above 250 K could be a conversion of either La4H<sup>23</sup> or La to a semimetallic or insulating phase, e.g. LaH<sup>3</sup> which has been reported to become semimetallic at high pressures [\\[2\\]](#page-10-1). We argue that La4H<sup>23</sup> is converting because Guo et al. observe a very similar change from metallic to non-metallic but don't have elemental lanthanum in their pressure cell. We note that LaH<sup>3</sup> has been ruled out as a high-T<sup>c</sup> material [\\[2\\]](#page-10-1) and could remain undetected in XRD in the presence of La4H<sup>23</sup> as shown in [Figure E6.](#page-15-1) In our sample the volume fraction of La4H<sup>23</sup> whilst decreasing, retains a full path to detect zero resistance during the course of our measurements whilst in the study of Guo et al., the nonzero resistance below 100 GPa suggests that a larger portion of the sample has transformed to a semimetallic state.\n\nThe change in resistance may be related to the thermodynamic and/or dynamical instabilities found in DFT calculations by Guo et al. [\\[14\\]](#page-11-7). At 100 GPa, the DFT predicts that La4H<sup>23</sup> is above the convex hull by a small energy. Such an energy scale could lead to a disintegration with an activation energy. In addition, DFT predicts imaginary phonons that indicate that the phase is inherently unstable. Such imaginary phonons are in contradiction with the observed presence of La4H<sup>23</sup> in the studies by Laniel, Guo, and in the present work. Hence, a mechanism like a superstructure of the hydrogen lattice must exist that stabilises La4H<sup>23</sup> against dynamical instabilities. This mechanism might still keep the material metastable with a low energy barrier comparable to the activation energy of ∼ 250 K observed here.\n\nFurther investigations are required to map the stability range of the La4H<sup>23</sup> phase including under the influence of excess or deficiency of hydrogen in the DAC. So far, all reported syntheses have employed hydrogen donor materials like NH3BH<sup>3</sup> and paraffin. It will be of interest to check if a synthesis in excess molecular hydrogen shows a larger stability range to lower pressures. Further X-ray diffraction that check for superstructures and decomposition are equally desirable but challenging.\n\nThe suppression of the resistive transition in magnetic field provides further evidence for superconductivity in La4H23. The transition is suppressed by 13 K in a magnetic field of 12 T as illustrated in [Figure 3](#page-8-0) (a). We extract Tc(H) in order to map the temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2(T) as shown in [Figure 3\\(](#page-8-0)b), where the zero-temperature value Hc2(0) is estimated from extrapolations of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) and WHH models, yielding 47 T and 63 T respectively. The linear regime of the critical field Hc2(T) can be used to estimate the zero-temperature coherence length ξ<sup>0</sup> of the superconducting state and the Fermi velocity v<sup>F</sup> of the normal state. Using the clean-limit expression, and the slope of the critical field near T<sup>c</sup> (dHc2/dT = -0.87 TK<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) we obtain ξ<sup>0</sup> = 2.7 nm. The change of the resistance to non-metallic indicates that the sample requires a dirty-limit expression. In the absence of direct or indirect measurements that allow to estimate the mean free path, the dirty-limit expressions cannot be used to extract ξ0. However, the clean-limit expression still provides a good estimate and likely only small corrections will arise from dirty-limit behaviour. Indeed the comparable slope of Hc2(T) observed by Guo et al. suggests that both studies observe the intrinsic behaviour of La4H23.\n\nThe Fermi velocity is estimated as v<sup>F</sup> = 1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> m s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . This value is lower compared to H3S [\\[17\\]](#page-12-1). Likely, this reflects a reduced renormalisation and hence a weaker electron-phonon coupling compared to H3S in agreement with the lower Tc. A more accurate estimation of the renormalisation requires detailed band structure calculations based on a stable structure.\n\n### IV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La4H<sup>23</sup> with the A15 structure reinforces that hydrogen cage structures are beneficial for superconductivity. The A15-type structure is so far the prime example of how high-temperature superconductivity can be realised below 100 GPa in a binary hydride material.\n\nThe XRD analysis suggests that La4H<sup>23</sup> is the major phase synthesised at pressures around 100 GPa. This may help forming pure samples in the future to study the intrinsic\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>FIG. 3. Superconducting critical field of La4H23.

METHODS\n\nHigh pressures were achieved in a DAC machined from MP35N alloy, with diamond anvils of culet diameter 50 µm bevelled at 8◦ to a diameter of 300 µm. Gaskets were prepared by pre-indentation of 250 µm steel 301 and insulated with a boron nitride and epoxy mixture. The insulation was indented to a thickness ∼ 30 µm and a sample space of diameter 28 µm was drilled. The anvil with the sample was first coated in 50 nm of alumina to provide a thermal insulation during laser heating and to help prevent diamond embrittlement from hydrogen diffusion. For electrical measurements, five bi-layer tungsten-gold electrodes were sputtered/evaporated directly onto one of the diamond anvils.\n\nA lanthanum film of thickness 260 nm was deposited onto the electrodes in a vacuum ∼ 1 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>7</sup> mbar after multiple pre-melts to remove oxide impurities from the La source. The La film was capped with a 5 nm layer of palladium to act as an oxidation barrier, and to catalyse hydrogen diffusion into the La sample [\\[18\\]](#page-12-2).\n\nDue to the hygroscopic nature of AB, we first purified by sublimation to remove any\nresidual moisture and impurities that would react with the La film. Loading of the AB into the gasket indentation and initial cell closing were done in an inert Ar atmosphere in a glove box with residual O2/H2O < 0.5 ppm. The sample was pressurised to 95 GPa with NH3BH<sup>3</sup> serving as the pressure transmitting medium (PTM).\n\nThe pressure was determined from the Raman shift of the diamond edge using the Akahama scale as shown in [Figure E7](#page-16-0) [\\[19\\]](#page-12-0). The unit cell volumes extracted from Le Bail refinement of residual lanthanum (Fmmm) and gold (Fm3m) [\\(Figure E8\\)](#page-16-1) from the electrodes are consistent with the pressure measured using the diamond edge [\\[20,](#page-12-1) [21\\]](#page-12-2).\n\nThe La film was characterised in resistance measurements prior to laser heating [\\(Fig](#page-17-0)[ure E9\\)](#page-17-0), confirming metallic behaviour with residual resistance ratio (RRR) ∼ 2.5. The superconducting transition of pure La is observed with T<sup>c</sup> = 8.6 K at 95 GPa which is ∼ 1 K higher than reported in previous studies [\\[20\\]](#page-12-1), and may originate from a pressure gradient across the sample (cf. sample pictures in [Figure E10\\)](#page-17-1).\n\nSynthesis of La4H<sup>23</sup> was achieved through heating of the sample and hydrogen donor material AB. The hydrogen released from AB is dissociated at the palladium capping layer and diffuses into the lanthanum film where it reacts to form La4H23. Heating of the sample was done using a 1064 nm YAG laser with multiple 300 ms pulses. Laser power was incremented after each successive pulse until glowing was observed indicating a temperature of ∼ 1000 K. The four-point resistance was monitored during heating, where the normal state resistance increased by a factor ∼ 20 indicating chemical reaction between the La film and the AB. No further heating of the sample was carried out after the first observed glowing in order to preserve the electrodes, which likely explains the residual lanthanum observed in XRD.\n\nX-ray diffraction was carried out at the I15 extreme conditions beamline at Diamond Light Source with a Pilatus3 X CdTe 2M area detector, wavelength λ = 0.425 ˚A (sampleto-detector distance 385 mm). The beam was collimated to 20 µm. The calibrant used was LaB6. Integration of the powder pattern and removal of spurious reflections were done in Dioptas [\\[22\\]](#page-12-3). Background subtraction and structural refinements were done in GSAS II [\\[23\\]](#page-12-4).\n\nElectrical transport measurements were done in a four-point configuration with an excitation current of 10 µA using either an SRS SIM921 AC resistance bridge or an SR830 lock-in amplifier. Magnetic field studies were done at the University of Bristol with an Oxford Instruments 14 T magnet.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful for discussions with Lewis Conway.

Hydrogen cage structures have been identified as a common motif beneficial for high critical temperatures Tc. Efforts are now focused on finding hydride high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures. We present evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in binary La4H23 with A15-type structure featuring hydrogen cages at a pressure of P = 95 GPa. We synthesise La4H23 from a lanthanum film capped with a palladium catalyst promoting the dissociation of hydrogen. In resistance measurements, we observe superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc = 90 K. In X-ray diffraction on the same sample, we identify the A15-type cubic body centred structure of the lanthanum sublattice. From comparison with earlier XRD and structure prediction studies, we identify this phase with La4H23. Our study reinforces the concept of hydrogen cages for high-temperature superconductivity.",
