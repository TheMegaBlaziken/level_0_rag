Box 3640, D -76021 K arlsruhe, G em any\n\n(April 14, 2024)\n\nW e re-exam ine the tunneling data on A 15 superconductors by perform ing a generalized M dV illan-Rowell tunneling inversion that incorporates a nonconstant electronic density of states obtained from band structure calculations. For N.b3Sn, we nd that the experim ental data can be slightly in proved by taking into account the shap structure in the density of states, but it is likely that such an analysis alone is not enough to completely explain the superconducting tunneling characteristics of this material. Nevertheless, the extracted E liashberg finction displays a num ber of features expected to be present for the highest quality N b3Sn sam ples.\n\nPrim ary : 74.70 Ad, 71.20 Be, 74.25 Jb, 74.25 K c\n\nT. TNT RODUCT TO N\n\nT wenty years ago, the A 15 superconductors in the A 3B structure, with A a transition metal and B an sp-m etal, w ere the highest transition tem perature superconductors known. The rst such superconductor found was V 3S , which was discovered in the 1950's to have a T 。 of about 17 K . In the ensuing years, other equilibrium com pounds like V 3G a and N b3 Sn were discovered to have To's in the range of 15-18 K . B -elem ent-poor com pounds like N b3 A 1, N b3G a, N b3G e, and N b3 Siwere also found, w th T .'s as high as 23 K . The structural, electronic, m agnetic, elastic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of these m aterials were widely studied .2;3\n\nThe use of tunneling spectroscopy to probe superconducting properties of the A 15 m aterials w as hindered by a num ber of m aterials issues. The fabrication of highquality tunnel junctions was di cult because the use of native oxides for the tunneling barrier did not yield reproducible results, and hence articcial barrier layers had to be grown on top of the A 15 superconductors. 45 As the quality of the tunneling data im proved, it becam e clear that these m aterials do not exhibit the sim ple behavior seen in conventional strong-coupling s-wave superconductors like Pb, Hg, and Nb. In particular, the reduced tunneling density of states displays a rapid overswing followed by a sharp return to zero at energies near and above the maxim um phonon energy. A revision of the M dM illan-Rowell tunneling analysis' by A mold and W olf allowed this data to be t to high precision by assum ing the presence of an additional norm alm etal layer (characterized by a width and a scattering strength) between the superconductor and the insulating barrier. How ever, to t the most recent experim entaldata within this proxim ity e ect modi ed tunneling theory, one needs to assum e that the w idth of the norm al region approaches zero while its scattering strength becom es unusually large.\n\nA ltematively, it has been suggested that the rapid oversw ing in the high-energy regim e in the tunneling density of states is related to the presence of sharp structures in the electronic density of states near the Ferm i level. Band-structure calculations show that the electronic density of states in these m aterials has peaks of width on the order of 100 m eV near the Ferm i energy. Such sharp structures require, at the very beast, a reform ulation of the M igdal E liashberg10 m any-body analysis to include e ects of a nonconstant electronic density of states 113 within an energy range on the order of the m axim alphonon energies of the m aterial.\n\n0 ther theories of superconductivity in A 15 com pounds go beyond simply generalizing the standard Migdal-E liashberg theory to allow for energy dependence in the density of states. For example, Yu and Anderson14 exam ine what happens in an electron-phonon system that is coupled strongly enough to have the single electron (polaronic) phase becom e unstable to bipolaronic (preform ed pair) phases. Such system s display quite di erent behavior, but these theories have not been developed to the point where direct com parison to m aterials speci c tunneling conductances can be m ade.\n\nSince the discovery of the high-T 。 cuprates, work on the A 15 com pounds has virtually ceased - this despite the m any fundam ental questions about these m aterials that rem ain open. In this paper, we investigate whether high-quality tunneling data for the A 15 m aterials can be understood within a conventional M igdal E liashberq fram ework generalized to include an energy-dependent electronic density of states. We perform this analysis and extract an experimentally t Eliashberg function 2F ( ), and Coulomb pseudopotential , for N b3Sn, which has T = 18 K . Data from high-quality tunnel junctions grown on this material are available.\n\nIn Section II, we derive the form alism needed to num erically perform the tunneling inversion including a nonconstant electronic density of states. This derivation and the com putationalalgorithm are di erent from those de-\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>veloped previously in that an exact analytic continuation that properly treats the Coulomb pseudopotential and allows the calculations to be perform ed relative to the norm al state is em ployed. In Section III, we present our num erical results for the tunneling inversion with both constant and nonconstant electronic density of states. Conclusions are presented in Section IV .\n\n## II.FORMALISM\n\nO ur analysis begins with the calculation of the band structure and electronic density of states (DOS). Calculations are carried out using the VA SP package,15 a plane-wave based density-finctional code using ultrasoft pseudopotentials.16 The electronic wave functions are expanded in plane waves up to a cuto of 219 eV , and the electron-electron interaction is treated within the local density approxim ation (LDA) with the Ceperley-A lder exchange correlation functional.47 The Brillouin zone is sam pled on a M onkhorst-Pack m esh18 of at least 20 20 20 points. We nd the optim ized crystal structure to be tetragonal, with a sm all distortion of the N b sublattice.19 The peaks in the density of states near the Ferm i levelare very sensitive to this sublattice distortion .\n\nIn conventional M igdal Eliashberg theory,10 the electronic density of states is chosen to be a constant (with an in nite \\bandwidth\"), and the energy cuto of the theory is provided by the nite range of the E liashberg function 2F ( ), which m easures the ability of a phonon of energy to scatter electrons on the Ferm i surface. W hen perform ing the many-body theory calculations, one begins on the im aginary axis, where the Coulom b pseudopotential has a sharp cuto ,20 and then perform s an exact num erical analytic continuation21 to calculate real-axis properties. This technique allow s for a proper treatm ent of the \\soft\" cuto for the Coulom b pseudopotential on the real axis. In addition, because the superconducting and norm al states appear m ore and m ore sim ilar at high energies, and because of the nite frequency cuto (chosen to be 6 m ax here), the self-energy begins to deviate from the exact result in the norm al state as the energy increases. One can correct for this by perform ing the perturbative expansion relative to the norm al state. In this case, one adds the exact norm alstate selfenergy m inus the norm al-state self-energy calculated with the energy cuto used in the superconducting theory.22 Such a scheme was used when exam ining e ects of vertex corrections23 in Pb. W hen an energydependent electronic density of states is used, such a com putational schem e becom es problem atic because there is no longer an exact analytic expression for the norm alstate selfenergy. Furtherm ore, a choice must be m ade for the energy cuto , because, assum ing a bandw idth on the order of a few eV and a tem perature on the order of 0.1 m eV , the num ber of M atsubara frequencies required for an energy cuto set by the bandw idth would be too\n\nlarge to perform calculations e ciently.\n\nW e adopt an altemative scheme here. We start by rst calculating the norm al state self energy at T = 0. Since the M atsubara frequencies becom e a continuum at T = 0, such a calculation can be perform ed sim ply by replacing the M atsubara sum m ations by integrals along the im aginary axis, which are com puted using conventional quadrature techniques. Next, we choose the energy cuto to be the sam e as that used in the constant density of states calculations, nam ely 6 m ax . W e calculate the selfenergy in the norm al state at T (relative to the norm al state at T = 0) with the nite energy cuto , and then add the T = 0 norm al-state self-energy (with no cuto ) to the nite tem perature self-energy. Then we calculate the superconducting self-energy relative to the norm al state at T using the sam e cuto . Finally, we add the full nom al-state self-energy at T to get the superconducting self-energy.\n\nOur m any body form alism on the im aginary axis follow s m ost closely to Ref. 13. We use a N am bu-G or kov form alism and evaluate the self-consistent perturbation theory (using dressed phonons) in the Hartree Fock approxim ation. (The H artree tem provides just a constant shift to the chem ical potential and is ignored.) Perturbative calculations are perform ed for the norm al state and the superconducting state. W e begin our analysis in the norm al state, where the resulting self-consistent equations are\n\n(\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\text{Z}\\_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{O}} & = & \\text{1} + \\underbrace{\\text{T}}\\_{\\text{!}\\_{\\text{m}}} \\overset{\\text{X}}{\\text{\\\\_}}\\_{\\text{n}} \\text{\\\\_}\\_{\\text{m}} \\\\ & & \\text{R} \\quad \\underbrace{\\text{(\\\\_)}}\\_{\\text{(\\\\_\\text{E}\\_{\\text{F}})}} \\underbrace{\\text{\\\\_}!\\_{\\text{n}} Z\\_{\\text{n}}^{\\text{O}}}\\_{\\text{\\\\_}} \\text{\\\\_}!\\_{\\text{n}} Z\\_{\\text{n}}^{\\text{O}} \\text{\\\\_}!\\_{\\text{n}} \\end{array} \\tag{2}$$\n\nA prime indicates the norm al state perturbation theory, i!n = i T (2n + 1) is the Ferm ionic M atsubara frequency, of the norm al state self energy, and Z . = z °(i! m ) = 1 Im (i.m )=! m )=! m is the so-called renorm alization function determ ined from the im aginary part of the norm alstate selfenergy.

Evaluating these integrals with quadrature routines is m uch m ore e cient than calculating the M atsubara sum s with a large energy cuto at nite tem perature.\n\n0 ur strategy for determ ining the functions (i! ) and Z (i! ) is to create a nonuniform ly spaced grid on the im aginary axis (we use 336 points), with an upper cuto m any times the electronic bandwidth. The grid is constructed in the following fashion. The rst grid point is chosen to lie at i! 0 = 0. Subsequent grid points are chosen by adding the new step size to the old grid point i! ++ 1 = i ! ; + i ; w ith ; increasing by a factor of 1.1 with each step from its initial value 0 = 0:09 m eV hence ;= 0:09 (1:1)].Werestrict ; < 400m eV if ; would be larger than 400 m eV , we set it equalto 400 m eV . T he grid is re ected about i! = 0 to construct the negative frequency axis. The integrals are then evaluated using a simple Riem ann sum over the nonuniform grid. O noe the finctions 8 and Z are known on the grid points, we linearly interpolate to evaluate them at any point on the im aginary axis.\n\nW e em ploy the T = 0 norm al-state solutions as an approxim ate solution for high frequency. This is included by rst calculating the norm al-state perturbation the ory at nite tem perature, using the same M atsubara frequency cuto as used in the superconducting state ! c = 6 max and then adding the di erence between the T = 0 norm al state solution and the nite-T solution to the superconducting solution, as shown below .

(at ! =\n\nTo solve all of these self-consistent equations and to invert the tunneling conductance to get the E liashberg finction, we begin with the LDA band-structure electronic density of states as input. W e take the band to consist of the states that contain nine electrons below the Ferm i level and four electrons above, corresponding to approxim ately 0:8 eV about Er . Hence the electron lling satis es the band-structure Ferm i level Er at T = 0 by solving Eq. (11). Then we take two initial guesses for N . (ii) For each N, we self-consistently solve for Eqs. (1) and (2) at T = 0.0 noe those functions are know n, (iii) we use a one-dim ensional root- nder to solve Eq. (12) to determ ine N . The next step is to determ ine the superconducting chem ical potential s and the Coulom b pseudopotential . We rst choose a quess for . W ith\n\nxed, we choose two initial guesses for self-consistently solve Eqs. (8), (9), and (10). O noe those finctions are determ ined, (v) we use a one-dim ensional root- nder to solve Eq. (13) and nd s . (vi) Now the real-axis equations for both the norm al state at T = 0, Eqs. (15) and (16), and the norm al and superconducting states at T , Eqs.(18), (19), and (20), are solved selfconsistently. Once the gap function (! ) is known, we can nd the superconducting gap 0. (vii) Steps (ir), (v), and (vi) are repeated for di erent values of until we nd the particular value where o = 3:15 m eV ,\n\nwhich is the(1st)perconducting gap for N b3 Sn at low tem perature. If we knew the correct Eliashberg function, then steps (i)-(vii) would be all that we need to calculate the RDOS from Eq. (22). But we need to nd the best t ( ) that is consistent with the experim ental RD O S . To do this, we simply em ploy the M dM illan-Rowell procedure for the tunneling inversion. We start with a quess for 2F . (viii) Next we calculate the functional derivative of how changes in the Eliashberg function a ect the RDOS. The finctional derivative is found by adding a sm all-weight G aussian to a given frequency or repeating steps (ii-vii) to determ ine the RDOS, and calculating the finctional derivative by taking the di erence of the new RDOS with the RDOS for the original Eliashberg function. This step (viii) is repeated for each frequency in the discrete 2F to determ ine the functional derivative m atrix. The next step (ix) is to choose the weights for adjusting 2F to t the experim entalRDO S better. Since the finctional derivative m atrix m ay be rank-de cient, we use a sinqular-value decom position to determ ine the updated weights. O noe the updated 2F ( ) is found, (x) we apply an exploratorydata-analysis robust smoother followed by a Hanning sm oother. Steps (viii-x) are repeated until the updated 2F ( ) ceases to produce a RDOS that is closer to experim ent. W e force the E liashberg function to be positive\n\neverywhere and to be quadratic for < 2.5 m eV . The step size for the discrete frequencies at which 2F is evaluated is 0.45 m eV . The algorithm is depicted pictorially in Fig. 1.\n\nThere is a num erical problem with this algorithm . In general, the weights for the shift in 2F are strongly os cillatory, which forces the Eliashberg function to have large am plitude narrow -w idth peaks. Since we do not expect the E liashberg function to have such sharp peaks, they need to be sm oothed away in the next update. Because the functional derivatives are not calculated with this sm oothing procedure (and there is no obvious way to incorporate the smoothing into the derivatives), we are lim ited in how closely we can reproduce the experim ental RDOS, even though we have the full freedom to adjust 2F .\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFIG .1.

H ence, we believe the m ost likely cause of the discrepancy is from anisotropic eects. It is conceivable\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>that tunneling barriers grow di erently on di erent indexed surfaces. The strong dependence of the tunneling conductance on barrier thickness thus could lead to a directional selectivity of the tunneling current and thereby anisotropy e ects would in uence the tunneling current even in the case of polycrystalline Im s.

For Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn, we find that the fit to the experimental data can be slightly improved by taking into account the sharp structure in the density of states, but it is likely that such an analysis alone is not enough to explain completely the superconducting tunneling characteristics of this material. Nevertheless, the extracted Eliashberg function displays a number of features expected to be present for the highest-quality Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn samples.",
