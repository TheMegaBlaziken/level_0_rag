We review the scaling relations for the critical current density (J.) in N b3Sn w ires and include recent ndings on the variation of the upper critical edd (H cc ) with tem perature (T) and A 15 com position. M easurem ents of H c2 (T) in inevitably inhom ogeneous wires, as well as analysis of literature results, have shown that all available H c2 (T ) data can be accurately described by a single relation from the m icroscopic theory. This relation also holds for inhom ogeneity averaged, e ective, H g (T) results and can be approxim ated by H c2 (t)=H c2 (0) = 1 = t =T .. K now ing H c (T ) is known. We highlight de ciencies in the Summers/Ekin relations, which are not able to account for the correct J. (T ) dependence. A vailable J 。 (H ) results indicate that the m agnetic eld dependence for all wires from with Kram er's ux shear model, if non-linearities in K ram er plots when approach ing the m axim um H c2 are attributed to A 15 inhom ogeneities. The strain ( ) dependence is introduced through a tem perature and strain dependent H ; ( ; ) and G inzburg-Landau param eter 1 (T ; ) and a strain dependent critical tem perature T2 ( ).

Introduction\n\nCritical current m easurem ents of N b3Sn wires are com m only interpolated and extrapolated using a set of em pirical relations for Jc(H ;T;), generally referred to as Sum m ers scaling [1]. A lthough these relations show acceptable accuracy for the description of lim ited data ranges [2], large discrepancies appear between the \f tted values for Tc(0) and H c2(0) and actual m easurem ents [3]. A lso at tem peratures above about 13 K and for large com pressive and tensile axial strains the Sum m ers scaling is inaccurate. It is thus not suitable for precise extrapolations of m easured results across a wide range. These de\f ciencies are generally recognized and lead to continuing discussions in the literature on im provem ents [2{12]. Presently, m uch of the interpretation ofm easured resultsand ensuing discussions rem ain largely em pirical and the proposed relations depend, for a signi\f cant part,on the initialassum ptions. A notable exception is the recent work by O h and K im [11,12]who use Eliashberg theory [13,14]in theirattem ptto arrive ata betterfounded scaling form alism .\n\nA s an alternative to em pirical approaches, a series of relations resulting from m icroscopic theory exist for Type II superconductivity. A lthough the criticalcurrent cannot be related quantitatively to the m icrostructure, various bulk pinning force m odels have been developed [15{23]. These can be com bined with theory on strain dependence [24{26]and the \f eld-tem perature phase boundary [27{47].The latterhave been shown to reasonably describe m easurem ents on wellde\f ned,quasi-hom ogeneous laboratory sam ples [35,43{46,48{51].\n\nIt is questionable, however, whether such relations can directly describe the behaviorofN b3Sn in technicalwiresdue to the inevitable presence ofinhom ogeneities. Com positional inhom ogeneities result from the A 15 stability range from about 18 to 25 at.% Sn [52], com bined with the solid state di usion processes during the A 15 form ation reaction in wires. The resulting Sn gradients have been unam biguously detected in wires by com positionalanalysis [53{57],property gradient m easurem ents [54{56,58{60] and sim ulations [56,60{62]. These com positional inhom ogeneities lead to signi\f cant changes in the electron-phonon interaction strength ep [63].The interaction strength changesfrom the weak coupling BCS lim it( ep 1) for 18 at.% Sn to ep = 1:8 for the stoichiom etric com position [48,63]. A s a result, signi\f cant changes occur in Hc2(T) with Sn concentration [48,49,63{67]. Since all stable A 15 com positions from 18 to 25 at.% Sn are observed in wires, a distribution ofproperties of about 5 T <sup>0</sup>H c2(0) 31 T and 6 K Tc(0) 18 K willoccur over the A 15 volum es [56]. In addition,it can be expected that also the strain state is far from hom ogeneous over the A 15 volum es in a wire. These argum ents render the validity ofa fullm icroscopic approach doubtful.M oreover,m icroscopic based relations can be relatively com plex and use a signi\f cant num ber ofparam eters to describe the m aterialinvolved. The m ain goalofthis article is to \f nd an im proved scaling relation which balances the need for better founded form alism s and practicalapplicability to m easured results in wires. A s a starting point we use three centralstatem ents,which\n\nw ill be detailed further throughout the article.\n\nOur rst statem ent is that the tem perature dependencies Ho (T) and H . (I ) (the them odynam ic critical eld) are known. We showed earlier [56,60] that the shape of H c (T ) is constant for all available N b 3Sn results, independent of the sample layout, m orphology, A 15 com position, strain state or applied critical state criterion and also holds for inhom ogeneity averaged, extrapolated, H , (T ) data. This means that the nom alized tem perature dependence of H ം can be described by a single, know n function from the microscopic theory. A lso H 。(T ) is known [11,68,69] and (T ) imm ediately follows through 1 = H22=( 2H .) [29]. This approach di ers from the tem perature dependence in the Summers relation, in which H .2 (T ) is calculated from an estim ated 1 (T ) [1].\n\n0 ur second statem ent is that non-linearities, which generally appear in K ram er plots [16]when approaching them axim um H ج that ispresent in a w ire, can be attributed to A 15 inhom ogenetties. This assum ption can be validated for speci c wire layouts through a combination of simulations and measurements [60,62]. A lternatively, one can chose to t m easured non-linearities assum ing a di erent pinning m odel as is often done [5,7,15,70]. This will in prove the quality of the t per speci c wire type when approaching the m axim um H o o, but this is also the regime where J . becom es very low . T his regim e is therefore of lim ited interest for applications. F itting this regim e per w ire type will obviously result in a reduced overall error but also in a m odel with sign.i cantly reduced generality. W e therefore chose not to include such non-linearities in the model.\n\nt to arrive at a generally valid relation for all Nl3Sn wires, with a validity up to the regime where the e ects of A 15 inhom ogeneity start to appear (typically from about 80% ofthem axim um H ~2).\n\nOur third statem ent is that the introduction of strain sensitivity occurs solely through strain induced changes in H c , T , and 1 . A ltemative approaches can lead to a strain dependent pre-constant in the J (H ; ) relation [5 { 7, 70], which im plies that the pinning e ciency changes with strain. A lihough this cannot be ruled out, it can be arqued that the required change in pinning e ciency of at least a factor of 2 over the relevant strain regime (below 1% axial strain) [7,70], is unrealistically large. A m ore reasonable approach to our opinion, is to assum e that the main e ect of strain is a m odi cation of the electron phonon interaction spectrum , which is supported by recent calculations [11, 12,24 {26]. This will obviously change directly Tc H & and thus 1. We will show below how this assum ption, com bined with a known tem perature dependence of H . and H . leads to a consistent introduction of strain and tem perature e ets in the J (H ;T ; ) relation by stating that H ; } (T ; ) and 1 ! ! ( ; ) . N ote that this is contrary to the usual uni cation of strain and tem perature dependence, w hich assum es tw o separate and di erent dependencies on H ു (T ) and H ം ( ) [71].\n\nW e will show below how these three starting points lead to a consistent, sim ple and accurate relation for J (H ;T ; ) . In Section 2, we w ill sum m arize the descriptions that are available throughout the literature and arrive at a general form for J . (H ; T ; ) . In Section 3, we will system atically compare this general form to measurements to\n\n## A generalscaling relation for N b3Sn 4\n\ndeterm ine the resulting scaling relation. The overallaccuracy willbe dem onstrated in Section [4](#page-27-0) and discussed in Section [5,](#page-28-0) together with a determ ination of the m inim al required set ofm easurem ents thatare needed to fully characterize a speci\f c wire. O ur conclusions are presented in Section [6.](#page-30-0)\n\n### <span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>2. T he criticalsurface\n\n### 2.1. M agnetic \feld dependence\n\n2.1.1. Relations for the Pinning Force The m agnetic \f eld dependence ofthe critical current density in N b3Sn is determ ined by de-pinning ofthe \nux-line lattice and thus by the m agnetic \f eld dependence ofthe bulk pinning force F<sup>p</sup> = J<sup>c</sup> B . The latter depends on the m icroscopic de-pinning m echanism . A generaldescription for Fp(H ) results from the observation that,fora m ultitude oflow tem perature superconductors, the bulk pinning force scales according to:\n\n$$\\left| \\mathbf{F}\\_{\\mathrm{p}} \\right\\rangle \\stackrel{\\mathrm{H}\\_{c2}}{\\longrightarrow} \\left| \\mathbf{f} \\right\\rangle;$$\n \n$$\\left| \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{f} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\tag{1}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>aswas\f rstpointed outby Fietz and W ebb [72].In [\\(1\\)](#page-3-1),h isthe reduced m agnetic \f eld H =H c2. The value for is often obtained by neglecting <sup>1</sup> and plotting the m axim um bulk pinning force against H c2 on a double logarithm ic scale. Values for found in this way are usually between 2 and 3 and for N b3Sn values of 2 and 2.5 are m ostly cited. H owever,since <sup>1</sup> m ay change up to 50% with tem perature (Section [2.2.3\\)](#page-9-0),its tem perature dependence cannotbe neglected foran accurate description ofthe critical surface ofN b3Sn.\n\nSeveralm odels forf(h) exist [16{18],but m ost often the K ram er version is used. K ram erderived two m odelsforf(h),using two regim es.Forthe regim e below the peak in f(h)he assum ed that\nux m otion prim arily occurs by de-pinning ofindividual\nuxlines,whereas in the regim e above the peak in f(h),de-pinning occurs by synchronous shear ofthe \nux-line lattice around line pins which are too strong to be broken. The latterisreferred to asthe \nux shear m odeland forthis regim e K ram erproposed [16]:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F}\\_{\\mathbf{p}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{C}\\_{66}}{12 \\stackrel{\\scriptstyle 2}{\\cdot} \\stackrel{\\scriptstyle 2}{\\cdot} 1 \\quad \\mathbf{a}\\_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\mathbf{P} - \\stackrel{\\scriptstyle 2}{\\cdot} \\stackrel{\\scriptstyle 2}{\\mathbf{a}\\_{0}}}} ; \\tag{2}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-3-2\"></span>where C<sup>66</sup> represents the elastic shearsti nessofthe \nux-line lattice,a<sup>0</sup> isthe \nux-line spacing and p represents the density ofthe pinning planes. In bulk N b3Sn,the grain boundaries are the m ain pinning centers [73{77]and can thus be interpreted as the pinning planes yielding 1= p = dav,the average grain size.\n\n<span id=\"page-3-3\"></span>O ne relation for the shear m odulus of the \nux-line lattice of a high \f eld superconductor withoutparam agnetic lim iting,was derived by Labusch [20]:\n\n<sup>C</sup><sup>66</sup> (<sup>H</sup> )= 7:<sup>4</sup> <sup>10</sup><sup>4</sup>( <sup>0</sup><sup>H</sup> c2) 2 2 1 (1 h) 2 N=m 2 : (3)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>The ux-line spacing can be estim ated by assum ing a triangular ux-line lattice [68]:\n\n$$\\mathfrak{A}\\_{\\mathsf{H}}\\left(\\mathsf{H}\\ \\rangle\\right) = \\begin{array}{c} \\mathsf{A} \\\\ \\end{array} \\qquad \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{025} \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ \\end{array} \\qquad \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{05} \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ \\end{array} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{05} \\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{4}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>C om bining (2) w th (3), assum ing 1= = d w and a triangular ux-line lattire with a spacing as given by (4) results in :\n\n$$\\text{F}\\_{\\text{p}}\\left(\\text{H}\\right) = \\text{12.8} \\frac{\\left(\\text{ }\\text{ $\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ } $}$ H $}\\_{\\text{c2}}\\text{$ }}\\right)^{2.8}}{\\text{1}^{2}} \\frac{\\text{h}^{0.5}}{\\text{( $\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ }} $H$ }} $}}\\left(\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ \\text{ $\\text{$ \\text{ $}}$ H $}}$ }}}\\text{ }\\text{G}\\text{N}=\\text{m}\\text{}\\text{}^{3}}\\text{ :}\\tag{5}$$\n\nU sing the K ram er form therefore results in = 2 in ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) ; if ( ( ) as f (h) = h05 (1 h f and (1 authors indeed state = 2:5 [1,16,17,62,71,78].\n\nHigher values for can be found if experim ental results are described with non-K ram er-like pinning. Deviating values for in (1) are reported by K roeger et al. [70] who claim = 3:0 and by Cheggour and Hampshire [5] who state = 3:2. It should be noted that both studies neglect 1 and t the experim ental results to Ey / (1 h) and Fo / (1 h) 5 respectively. This choice suggests di erent pinning behavior. It will be explained below that such high values for the power above (1 h) can arise when sam ple inhom ogeneities are ignored. Here, they will be accounted for, which results in the experim entally supported assum ption that F o / (1 h), as will be discussed in m ore detail in Section 3.1.\n\nCombining (5) with the reverse de nition of the Lorentz force gives (Suenaga and W elch in [79]) :\n\n$$\\mathbf{D}\\_{\\rm c}^{\\rm 0.5} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\text{ ${}\\_{0}\\rm H$ } \\end{array} \\right)^{0.25} = \\frac{\\mathbf{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{1} \\quad \\mathbf{1} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}{\\mathbf{1}} \\frac{\\mathbf{1} \\, \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\text{ ${}\\_{0}\\rm H$ } \\end{array} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{ ${}\\_{0}\\rm H$ } \\end{array} \\right\\}}{\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\text{ ${}\\_{0}\\rm H$ } \\end{array} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{ ${}\\_{0}\\rm H$ } \\end{array} \\right)} ; \\tag{6}$$\n\nIn m ost technical w ires dg, is 100 to 200 nm , w hereas the spacing decreases rapidly below 50 nm for m agnetic elds above 1 T .

Low \feld linearity ofK ram er plots The dependence F<sup>p</sup> / (1 h) <sup>2</sup> occurswhen shear deform ation ofthe \nux-line lattice is the prim ary de-pinning m echanism as was m entioned above. This was shown experim entally by Cooley et al.[80]to be the case when the grain size issubstantially largerthan the \nux-line spacing (dav > 2a<sup>M</sup> (H )).If the grain size is com parable to the \nux-line spacing,a direct sum m ation ofindividual pinning interactionsbetween grain boundariesand \nux-linesoccurs,which corresponds toF<sup>p</sup> / (1 h)[20,22,80].PlotsoftheK ram erfunction f<sup>K</sup> from [\\(7\\)](#page-4-2)versusm agnetic\f eld (a 'K ram erplot'),calculated from J<sup>c</sup> data m easured on N b3Sn conductors,aregenerally linear in the 'standard'J<sup>c</sup> m easurem ent regim e ofabout 0:2 < h < 0:6. This supports shearing of the \nux-line lattice as the prim ary de-pinning m echanism , provided that the grain size islargerthan about100 nm [80].M oreover,K ram erplots resulting from m agnetization data on Powder-in-Tube processed wires,reacted atvarioustem perature and tim e com binations, were shown to be perfectly straight down to h = 0:07 at various tem peratures by Fischer [58]. A lso transport J<sup>c</sup> m easurem ents on di erent bronze processed wires indicated straight K ram er plots at various tem peratures down to h = 0:04 [10,78]. O bserved downward curvature when approaching lower m agnetic\n\n\f eldscan,apartfrom a di erentpinning behavior,additionally arise through self-\f elds generated by the large transport current densities. A ccurate correction for these self- \f elds isnon-trivial.\n\nTheseobservationsvalidatetheapplication of[\\(5\\)](#page-4-1)to very low \f eldsand supportthe assum ption thatthe(1 a<sup>M</sup> =dav)term hasnegligible in\nuence and can beapproxim ated by (1 a<sup>M</sup> =dav) = 1. M oreover,they indicate that for technicalwires,which have an average grain size above 100 nm ,shear deform ation ofthe \nux-line lattice apparently rem ains the prim ary de-pinning m echanism also below the m axim um in Fp. The assum ptions used to arrive at the K ram er m odel have received som e criticism [21]. In practice,however, using the high m agnetic \f eld description ofK ram er appears to hold forN b3Sn wires,atleastdown to 1 T.\n\n2.1.3. Linearity of K ram er plots approaching H c2 A bove h = 0:8, non-linearities are m ostly observed in K ram er plots ofwire results when approaching the m axim um H c2 that is present in the wire. The pinning force function [\\(5\\)](#page-4-1), com bined with the approxim ation (1 a<sup>M</sup> (H )=dav)= 1 is therefore often written in a m ore generalform :\n\nF<sup>p</sup> (H )= Fp m axf(h)= C ( <sup>0</sup>H c2) 1 h <sup>p</sup> (1 h) q ; (9)\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>whereC isa constantand p and q determ inef(h).Thisallowsforinsertion ofdi erent valuesofpand qthatim plicatea di erentpinning behavior,butm ostprobably originate from inhom ogeneity averaging. Such di erent values for p and q lead to stillongoing discussion in the literature whether or not a generalpinning m echanism ,or f(h),can be assum ed forN b3Sn wires.\n\nThe \f eld dependence ofthe bulk pinning force asgiven by [\\(9\\)](#page-5-0)isshown in \f gur[e1](#page-6-0) and com bined with K ram erplotsforvariousvaluesofq around 2.A variation ofp only in\nuences the low \f eld region.

C alculated changesw ith q in the\feld dependence ofthe bulk pinning force (left plot) and K ram erfunction (rightplot).\n\nK ram er plots at lower m agnetic \f elds for bronze and Powder-in-Tube processed wires, however,render strong deviations ofp from 0.5 unlikely.\n\nA 25% variation in q results in a change in the m axim um pinning force and its position and an up- or downward curvature in the K ram er plot for h ! 1. The e ect of a lowering of q, i.e. an increase of the m axim um pinning force com bined with a shift ofits position towards higher m agnetic \f eld is identicalto what has been observed experim entally through grain re\f nem ent in Powder-in-Tube wires by Cooley et al. [80]. U pward and downward tails in K ram er plots have both been observed experim entally (e.g. Ekin in [15],[60],Suenaga in [81],[82]) and have been attributed to m icrostructural[83]and com positional(Ekin in [15],[60],Cooley etal.[62],Suenaga and W elch in [79]) origins. A range of experim entally detectable H c2 values could also be attributed to \nux-creep and therm alactivated \nux- ow (e.g.the presence ofan 'irreversibility \f eld'in high tem peraturesuperconductors),butwe\f nd thatthesee ects are negligibly sm allcom pared to the severe in\nuence ofcom positionalinhom ogeneities on H c2 [64],especially attem peratures below 20 K .\n\nThem ostconvincing supportforattributing curvaturein K ram erplotswhen h ! 1 to inhom ogeneitiesisgiven by Cooley etal.[62],who num erically m odeled the\f lam ents in a Powder-in-Tube processed wire as concentric shells with di erent Sn content and thus di erentHc2 and Tc. It was assum ed that each com position behaves according to q = 2. A n area weighted sum m ation ofthe transport current density ofsuch a system ofparallelpaths ofvariable property showed that a concave tailappears in the overall K ram er plots when the m axim um available H c2 is approached. Increasing the severity ofthe Sn gradientin the A 15 sectionsincreasesthe occurrence ofsuch tailsin otherwise linear overallK ram er plots. This parallelpath m odelis supported by m easurem ents on sim ilarPIT processed wires[56,60].Such an area weighted sum m ation overparallel paths oflesser and better A 15 quality results in a sim ilar overallK ram er plot as for p = 0:5 and q = 2:5 in \f gur[e1.](#page-6-0) A downward tailin K ram er plots,as is often observed in bronze processed wires,can be described with q < 2 as isshown in \f gur[e1,](#page-6-0)thereby again im plicitly assum ing a di erentde-pinning m echanism .H owever,assum ing a serial connection oflesser and better A 15 quality regions for the m ore irregular \f lam ents in bronze processed wires,also results in a downward tailin K ram er plots when h ! 1,\n\nsince the lower quality A 15 sections will determ ine the overall transport properties. This arqum entation is a strong indication that the curvature is not due to di erent de pinning m echanism s but to inhom ogeneity e ects and thus that q should be 2.\n\nIt can thus be stated that the Kram er ux-line shear model, at constant composition, is valid over nearly the fill magnetic eld range, ie. up to H22 and down to a m aqnetic eld where the ux-line lattice spacing becom es approxim ately m ore than half of the A 15 grain size [80], which is below 1 T from (4). N on-linearthies in K ram er plots when approading the m axim um present H 2 are thus attributed to inhom ogeneity averaging. The e ective bulk values H2, and T2, as detected by critical current m easurem ents, are weighted averages over the A 15 volum e, but it is not always clear how the averaging occurs. The discussion above leads to the conclusion that there is no a priori reason to deviate from F . / h15 (1 h) , provided that the inevitable presence of A 15 inhom ogeneit.ies in w ires is recognized.\n\n#### 2 2 . Tem perature dependence\n\nTo com e to an overall description for J ; (H ; T ; ) , the tem perature dependence of the bulk pinning force is considered. In observing (9) it is clear that tem perature dependence occurs through tem perature dependence of H ~ and 1 :\n\n$$\\mathbf{F\\_p \\text{ (H }\\sharp\\text{T)} = C \\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{I}\\_0}\\mathbf{H\\_{c2}}\\text{ (T)} \\mathbf{\\hat{I}\\_s}}{\\mathbf{\\hat{I}\\_s}\\text{ (T)}} \\mathbf{\\hat{f}\\_s} \\text{ (h)}\\text{ ;}\\tag{10}$$\n\nw th h = H =H & (T ) . It is thus required to discuss the available descriptions for H o2 (T ) and 1 (T). For both param eters, em pirical as well as m icroscopic alternatives are available. In the Summers relation [1] em pirical form s are used. It w ill be shown here, how these can be replaced by alternatives with a better connection to the m icroscopic theory.\n\n2 2.1. Em pirical tem perature dependence F irst, the em pirical tem perature dependence of the upper critical eld, as used in the Summers relation, is introduced. Based on earlier work by Suenaga in [81] and Ham pshire et al. [78], Summers et al. [1] proposed an em pirical relation for the tem perature dependence of the upper critical veld, thereby im proving the correspondence between the available scaling relations and measured results:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{H}\\_{c2} & \\text{(T)} \\\\ \\text{H}\\_{c2} & \\text{(0)} \\end{array} &=& 1 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{(T)} \\\\ & 1 \\\\ & 1 \\end{array} \\\\ &=& 1 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{(T)} \\\\ & 1 \\end{array} \\\\ &=& 1 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{(T)} \\\\ & 1 \\end{array} \\\\ &=& 1 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{(T)} \\\\ & 1 \\end{array} \\end{aligned} \\tag{11}$$\n\nwhere t = T=T ..

[78] claim a validity range only below 13.5 K for their calculated 1 (T ) values.\n\n2 2 . M icroscopic based H . 2 (T ) A n early m icrosopic description for the tem perature dependence of the upper critical eld was sim ultaneously derived in 1964 by M aki [26,29] and De Gennes [27,30] which, written in the De Gennes form yields the implicit relation (MDG relation) :\n\n$$\\mathbf{h} \\cdot \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{T} \\\\ \\mathbf{T}\\_{\\mathbb{C}} \\text{ (\\n\\nA)} \\end{array} = \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{2} \\end{array} \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{1}{2} + \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\sim D}\\_{\\ \\mathbf{0}} \\mathbf{H}\\_{\\ \\mathbf{C}} \\text{ (\\n\\nA)} \\\\ \\mathbf{2} \\end{array} \\Big| \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\tilde{T}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{T}} \\end{array} \\Big| \\tag{12}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>The function uses only two param eters, nam ely T (0) (which can be m easured) and the di usion constant of the norm al conducting electrons D . The di usion constant is inversely proportional to the slope of the H & (T ) dependence at T . (0) [56,60]. The other param eters are the reduced Planck constant (~), the m agnetic = ux quantum =( ) and the Boltzm ann constant (kg). The term s (x) represent the digam m a finction (84]. The description was derived assum inq a dirty superconductor (i.e. \\ spherical Ferm i surface approxim ation and assum es a constant density of states at the Ferm ilevelN (Ep) and a weak election phonon interaction. Furtherm ore it assum es no param agnetic limitation ofH ം (T ) and an absence of spin-orbit scattering.

A power of 1.5 was also found recently from analysis using Eliashberg theory by O h and K im [11].\n\nA pplication of the firll E liashberg based form alism s is the m ost correct approach, since it accounts for all the election phonon interaction strengths. However, there are two reasons for applying only the simplest form of the microscopic descriptions [i.e. (12) ] to w ire results. F irst, since w ires are inherently inhom ogeneous there is no single H & (T ) but a distribution of properties [60]. A lso, the inaccessbility of the norm alstate resistivity (which is a prim e param eter in the microscopic theory) of the A 15 in wires renders a proper connection to the theory practically in possible. Second, the use of the form al descriptions results in an increased num ber of param eters com pared to (12). T his can be avoided by in plan enting the additional param eters that are required for a proper connection to the microscopic theory in D [and thus in the slope at To(0) [60]] and To (0) in (12). To allow this it has to be assum ed that the shape of H 2 (T ), at least to rst order, rem ains unchanged.\n\nThe simplest form of the microscopic descriptions, the MDG relation (12), was tested previously and found to t Hg (T) for all available literature N by Sn results and\nm easurem ents on a m ultitude of wires with very high accuracy [60]. This accuracy holdsforthe O rlando etal.thin \f lm results[48]atallSn concentrations,theFonerand M cN i single-and polycrystalline results[50,51],and theJewelletal.bulk results[67]. The single crystals are close to stoichiom etric and thus strong coupling [63]and m ost probably clean. The thin \f lm s and bulk sam ples are of varying degree ofresistivity and Sn content and cover therefore a large range from approxim ately clean to dirty and weak to strong coupling. This leads to the conclusion that the shape ofthe \f eldtem perature phase boundary is,within the experim entalerrorbars,independentofthe electron-phonon coupling strength (which can also be con\f rm ed from the theory [40]), independent on whether the m aterial is clean or dirty, and not in\nuenced by the (unlikely [44,48,56,85]) presence of PPL and spin-orbit scattering. It can thus be expected that it can be validated for the entire range ofcom positions that are present in wires. This is con\f rm ed by the fact that it also holds for K ram er extrapolated, inhom ogeneity averaged H K c2(T)results [60].\n\n2.2.3. M icroscopic based <sup>1</sup>(T) From the m icroscopic theory [41]it follows that for weak coupling superconductors in the dirty lim it <sup>1</sup>(0)=1(Tc) = 1:2. In the strong coupling lim it this ratio saturates at about 1.5 [41],which m eans that the m axim um expectable change in <sup>1</sup>(T)is50% from 0 K to Tc.\n\nFor calculation of <sup>1</sup>(T)=1(0) for a given interaction strength the nonlinear Eliashberg equations [13] will have to be solved as was done num erically by R ainer and Bergm ann [41]. N o generalsim ple function for <sup>1</sup>(T)=1(0),derived directly from the electron-phonon spectrum and thus valid for all ep, can therefore be given for wires. Fortunately, a generalized function can be derived for <sup>1</sup>(T)=1(0) through <sup>1</sup> = H c2=( p 2H <sup>c</sup>),using the m icroscopic form for H c2(T)=H c2(0) [\\(12\\)](#page-8-0) com bined with the tem perature dependence ofH <sup>c</sup>.\n\nIt is well accepted that H <sup>c</sup>(t)=H <sup>c</sup>(0) is for all superconductors very close to (1 t <sup>2</sup>) [68]. R ecent calculations based on Eliashberg theory yield H <sup>c</sup>(t)=H <sup>c</sup>(0) = (1 t <sup>2</sup>:<sup>17</sup>) [11]. The deviation from (1 t <sup>2</sup>) is m easured for N b3Sn [69]and is within about2% .A \f tto them easured Hc(t)=H <sup>c</sup>(0)yields(1 t <sup>2</sup>:<sup>07</sup>).Forpracticalapplications a power of 2 will thus be su ciently accurate.

Strain dependence\n\n2.3.1. Strain dependence in N b3Sn wires W hen a N b3Sn com posite wire is subjected to longitudinalcom pressive strain,the criticalcurrent density,upper critical\f eld and criticaltem perature reduce approxim ately linearly and reversibly with strain. W hen\n\na wire is subjected to a longitudinal tensile strain, the critical param eters increase approxim ately proportionally and reversibly with strain untila parabolic-like peak is reached, after which the properties reduce approxim ately linearly with strain. The largertherm alcontraction ofthe m atrix m aterialscom pared to the therm alcontraction ofthe N b3Sn results in an axialpre-com pression ofthe A 15 when cooled from reaction tem perature to the testtem perature below 20 K .W hen the wire isaxially loaded after cool-down,thispre-com pression ism inim ized and Jc,H c2 and T<sup>c</sup> increase.The position ofthe m axim um in the strain dependency curve appears at the point where the threedim ensional deviatoric strain com ponents in the A 15 are m inim al. In practice this correlates closely to the point where the axialpre-com pression ofthe A 15 is m inim al. The axial pre-com pression is m ostly identi\f ed by <sup>m</sup> , whereas the position of the m inim um in the deviatoric strain com ponents is identi\f ed as . Severalm odels have been introduced in the literatureto describe thisbehavior,ranging from polynom ial\f ts to relationsbased on the Eliashberg theory.These willbe discussed below.\n\nW hen an A 15 lattice is deform ed, its vibration m odes willchange. In addition, the electronic structure willbe m odi\f ed and therefore N (E<sup>F</sup> ). It is thus reasonable to expect a strain induced variation ofthe electron-phonon interaction spectrum and the phonon density ofstates and hence,a change in the interaction constant ep. The di erence between the strain sensitivity ofHc2 and T<sup>c</sup> represents an im portant link to m icroscopic understanding since both depend di erently on N (E<sup>F</sup> )and ep.Itisfound experim entally that[71,94]:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{H}\\_{\\text{c2}}\\text{ (4.2K}; \\text{ '} )}{\\text{H}\\_{\\text{c2m}}\\text{ (4.2K ) = }} = \\frac{\\text{T}\\_{\\text{c2}}\\text{ (1 ) }}{\\text{T}\\_{\\text{cm}}} \\stackrel{\\text{\\textdegree C}}{\\text{'}} ; \\tag{16}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>where the index 'm 'indicates the values ofH c2 and T<sup>c</sup> at the m axim um ofthe axial strain dependency curve. The power\\$ = 3,indicatesthatH c2 isroughly 3 tim esm ore sensitive to strain than Tc. This was found to be valid at alltem peratures (e.g.[3,4]). A n attem pt was m ade by W elch [94], following earlier work by Testardi [95{97], to explain the observed di erence in strain sensitivity on the basis ofthe strong coupling renorm alized BCS theory, using a M cM illan [98]based, A llan and D ynes [99]strong coupling form ulation for Tc. It was concluded that \\$ = 3 cannot be explained by either a change in N (E<sup>F</sup> ) or ep alone and the strain dependence should therefore be described by a com bination ofboth.Itshould be pointed out,however,thatM cM illan based descriptions for T<sup>c</sup> are valid for ep < 1:5 [100], whereas reported values for N b3Sn are m ostly higher[48]. It isclear,however,thatim proved understanding ofthe value for \\$ should result from exact calculations of strain induced m odi\f cations on the fullelectron-phonon interaction spectrum and the density ofstates. This m ight be possible through a com bination ofthe recent e ortsofM arkiewicz [24{26]and O h and K im [11,12]. A n im portant conclusion drawn by W elch is that in a three-dim ensional strain description the deviatoric strain com ponents dom inate the strain sensitivity of N b3Sn and thathydrostatic com ponents have,in com parison,a negligible e ect.\n\nM ost strain dependencies are de\f ned through the strain dependence ofthe upper critical \f eld or the critical tem perature.

Available m odels Five m odels describing the strain sensitivity of N b3Sn can be distinguished throughout the literature. The sim plest form is an introduction of hydrostatic strain though a pressure term . A lthough this yields a relatively sim ple connection to therm odynam ic calculations to describe single crystalhydrostatic experim ents, it is not suited for m ore practical system s such as wires due to the dom inating deviatoric com ponents. A n em pirical \f t for axial deform ations in wires was recently adapted by H am pshire and co-authors [6]in the form of a fourth-order polynom ial.A lthough thiswillobviously resultin accurate \f tsto experim entaldata,it lacks any connection to the underlying physics,and is thus notsuited forthe goalsset out for this article. The three rem aining m odels that have been proposed to describe experim ents on wires willbe discussed nextin chronologicalorder.\n\nThe \f rstm odelthatwasproposed to describe the strain dependence ofthe critical properties ofN b3Sn com posite wires wasthe so-called power-law m odel,introduced by Ekin in 1980 [71]. The m odelwas developed based on m easurem ents using an axial pullstrain device. The investigated com pressive strain range was therefore lim ited to the therm alpre-com pression ofthe A 15,introduced by the m atrix com ponents ofthe wires. A power-law dependence was proposed for s( ) using the extrapolated upper critical\f eld [71]. In this power-law dependence,a di erent axialstrain (a) sensitivity is used for <sup>a</sup> < 0 and for <sup>a</sup> > 0. The power-law m odelis an em piricaldescription that does not account for the three-dim ensional nature of strain, but includes the generally observed asym m etry in axial strain experim ents. O bservable linearities at large com pressive longitudinalstrains are not accounted for and it is therefore valid over a lim ited strain regim e.\n\nThesecond m odelthatwasproposed wastheso-called deviatoricstrain m odel.For high com pressive strainsTen H aken found an approxim ate lineardependence ofH K c2 on axialstrain,deviating from the power-law behavior [102,103]. These deviations from the power-law m odelat large com pressive axialstrain values,com bined with results of experim entson quasitwo-dim ensionalN b3Sn tapeconductors[104{106](which allow an analyticalcalculation ofthe three-dim ensionalstrain com ponents)led to an alternative description based on thenon-hydrostatic,i.e.distortionalordeviatoricstrain [8,104].In this deviatoric strain m odelonly the second strain invariant is considered. The m odel is em pirical, does account for the three-dim ensionalnature of strain and linearity at large com pressive axialstrains,but is sym m etricalaround the m axim um in the strain dependency curve,and isclaim ed to be valid only forthe com pressive strain regim e.\n\nThe third m odel available in the literature is the so-called full invariant strain analysis [24{26]. This m odelis based on the assum ption that the strain dependence ofT<sup>c</sup> results from the strain dependence of the phonon m odes in the N b3Sn crystal\n\nlattice. The model uses a full invariant strain analysis which correlates the strain dependence of T. to strain induced changes in the phonon frequency spectrum using relations that stem from Eliashberg theory and a strain energy potential finction. The m ain result of the fill invariant model is that it is able to dem onstrate the e ect of the ham onic and anham onic term s in the strain energy potential finction independently. It explains how the T - reduction due to hydrostatic strain decreases linearly with axial strain. It further explains the experim entally observed parabolic-like behavior around the m axim um , the linearity for large com pressive axial stain values and the asyn m etry, in tem s of the second and third strain invariants. For now , unfortunately, it does not include a description for H , ( ), which is required for J scaling. The latter might be provided by a combination of recent prom ising work by O h and K in [[1,12] and a fiill invariant analysis.\n\n2.3.3. Em pirical correction to the deviatoric strain model The full invariant analysis is them ost properm ethod available for the introduction of strain dependency of the critical properties. The resulting relations, however, rem ain som ew hat com pared to the em pincal ts, and a complete description for T. ( ) and H.A ( ) is not filly developed yet. It is clear that the em piricalm odels all lack speci c details in com parison to the fi.il invariant analysis. An em piricalm odel that accounts for three dimensionality, linearity at large axial strain, and asymm etry, in agreem ent with the invariant analysis, can be obtained by assum ing a simple mathen atical correction to the Ten H aken deviatoric strain m odel [56]. O ur starting point is relation (3) in [8]:\n\n$$\\mathbf{C\\_{0}H\\_{\\text{c2}}}\\text{ (\\text{\\textquotedblleft}\\text{\\textquotedblright})} = \\mathbf{C\\_{0}H\\_{\\text{c2}}}\\text{ (\\text{\\textquotedblleft}\\text{\\textquotedblright})} \\quad \\mathbf{C\\_{\\text{defv}}} \\text{ (\\text{\\textquotedblleft}\\text{\\textquotedblright})}^{2} + \\mathbf{(\\text{\\textquotedblleft}\\text{\\textquotedblleft}\\text{\\textquotedblright})}^{2};\\tag{18}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-12-1\"></span><span id=\"page-12-0\"></span>in which der represents the second deviatoric strain invariant, C dev represents the slope in the linear regime of of ( dev ), and on represents the non-axial, rem aining strain com ponents when the axial strain is zero. In axial form (18) can be written as [8,56]:\n\nwhere C is a constant and 0% represents the rem aining strain com ponents, as with the factor oxi in (18). To account, in the axial form of the Ten Haken model, for a stronger reduction at tensile strains, a linear term causing a reduction of H & with axial strain is required. This can be achieved by including an additional linear term in (18) :\n\nw here C inv2 and C inv3 are constants representing the second and third strain invariants. The tem ond now represents the initial suppression of H 2 due to hydrostatic strain. A sim ilar route can be followed for the axial version (19), resulting in :\n\n$$\\mathbf{^0H\\_{c2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0H\\_{c2}}\\text{ (\\ 0)}\\qquad \\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ \\_a}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{)}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a2}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^0\\_{a1}}\\text{ (\\ )}=\\mathbf{^$$\n\nin which <sup>a</sup> = applied + .

In addition, som e strain dependence through strain induced changes of the ux-line to lattice interactions could be assum ed. To arrive at an overall description, it is thus required to have know ledge of { ; }, and/or to introduce a strain dependent constant C ( ).\n\n2.4.1. Ekin's uni cation of strain and temperature dependence In analyzing critical current versus strain data at 4.2 K Ekin [71] found that the bulk pinning force scales, in analogy to the Fietz and W ebb scaling law (1), as:\n\n$$\\mathsf{F}\\_{\\mathsf{p}} \\nplus \\mathsf{y}\\_{\\mathsf{i}} \\ntriangleright \\quad \\mathsf{\\mathsf{H}}\\_{\\mathsf{c2}} \\ntriangleright \\mathsf{\\mathsf{i}} \\text{ \\(\\mathsf{i}\\)} \\mathsf{f} \\ntriangleright \\tag{25}$$\n\nwhere n = 1.0 0 :3 and the star again indicates a bulk average.

Ekin solved this inconsistency by postulating a com bination in term s of explicit dependencies on tem perature and strain.

The combination of strain and tem perature sensitivity was introduced on a filly em pirical basis, based on 4.2 K critical current data.

The Summers relation is thus, apart from the preconstant, consistent with [\\(31\\)](#page-15-2). It has \f nally to be quoted that H am pshire et al. stated [78],in relation to substantialinhom ogeneity oftheir sam ples,that the validity oftheir calculated <sup>1</sup>(T) results is expected to break down for T > 13:5 K . It willbe shown below that this, through com parison ofthe Sum m ers form [\\(11\\)](#page-7-1)to the m icroscopic based form [\\(15\\)](#page-9-0)and m easured results,indeed appearsto be the case.\n\n2.4.4. Alternative approaches The em piricalbases in the relations proposed by Ekin and Sum m ers et al.,their inaccuracy,and the extensive new Jc(H ;T;) data sets for wiresthathavebecom eavailableoverthepastdecadehaveevoked a re-analysisofoverall scaling behavior in N b3Sn wires. Two alternative approaches can be distinguished, focusing either on im proving the strain and tem perature dependent term s [4,9], or focusing on im proving the basis ofthe strain dependence ofC =1(T;) <sup>2</sup> in [\\(24\\)](#page-14-0)[5{7].\n\nIn the \f rst approach it is stated that, since the strain dependence through the power-law function doesnotaccountforlinearity athigh com pressive strains,itshould be replaced by a function that does. This was done through a change in s( ) from the power-law form to the Ten H aken form . Secondly,it was assum ed that [\\(31\\)](#page-15-2),and thereby the Sum m ersversion,isvalid butthatthe em piricaltem perature dependencies as proposed by Sum m ers et al. [i.e. [\\(11\\)](#page-7-1)] are in error and can be im proved upon. The generalform [\\(10\\)](#page-7-0) was chosen in [4,9]under the condition that s( ) from [\\(17\\)](#page-11-0) is independent oftem perature,[\\(16\\)](#page-10-0)hasgeneralvalidity and (1 a<sup>M</sup> (H )=dav)= 1.\n\nThetem peraturedependencein [\\(10\\)](#page-7-0)isdeterm ined by theratio [ <sup>0</sup>H c2(T)]=1(T) . Four-dim ensionalparam eterleastsquares\f tsusing extensive data setson a six di erent wires and highly linear K ram er plots indicated n = 1 (as stated by Ekin),p = 0:5 and q = 2 (asstated by K ram erforh > 0:2).Sincethetem peraturedependenciesofH c2 and <sup>1</sup> were fully em piricalin theSum m ersform ,both powers and were regarded asfree param eters to allow for errors in the tem perature dependencies.

It was expected that if correct dependencies for H c2(T) and <sup>1</sup>(T) were used,that sim ilar accurate \f ts would be obtained with values for and , which are consistentwith K ram er'spinning theory,i.e. = 2:5 and = 2.H owever,in Section [3,](#page-18-0)wewillre-analyzeoneoftheseearlierdata-setswith therecentnew insightson inhom ogeneity averaging e ects and the now known tem perature dependencies Hc2(T) and <sup>1</sup>(T),and show thatthe deviating values = 2 and = 1 are correct.\n\nThe second approach to im prove upon the Sum m ers relation em phasizes on the di erentdependenciesofthebulk pinning forceon tem peratureand strain in an attem pt to de\f ne a betterfounded com bination ofboth dependencies.Following initialwork by K roegeretal.[70]thisresults in a generalrelation ofthe form [5{7]:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F}\\_{\\mathsf{p}} \\text{ (}\\mathsf{H}\\text{ :T}\\text{ : }\\mathsf{h} = \\mathsf{A} \\quad \\text{(}\\mathsf{h}\\text{ ) [}\\_{0}\\mathbf{H}\\_{\\mathsf{c2}}\\text{ :T}\\text{ : }\\mathsf{h}\\text{ :T}\\text{ :H}\\text{ :H}\\text{ :}\\text{ :}\\text{ :}\\text{ }\\mathsf{h}\\text{ :}\\text{ :}\\text{ }\\tag{34}$$\n\nin which n, p and q are free param eters and A ( ) is a finction of strain alone. Several versions for A ( ) have been proposed [also including 1 (T ; )] in attempts to describe strain induced m odi cations of the ux-line to pinning center interactions and the strain dependence of 1.\n\n2 4.5 . Selected general scaling relation In general it can be stated that much of the developm ents on overall scaling behavior rem ains en pirical and it is unlikely that this em pirical basis can be fully rem oved. A s a nal rem ark it should be m entioned that in a four-dim ensional description with a large num ber of fire param eters it offen rem anns a som ewhat subjective choice which param eters are xed or allow ed to vary, in addition to the choice of relationships that can be implem ented.\n\nThe overall scaling law that is proposed in this article will now be sum m arized. It is assum ed that the critical current density scales according to (24) in the m ost general form :\n\n$$\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm c} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{H} \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\ \\mathbf{L} \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\mathbf{C}}{\\mathbf{C}} \\frac{\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{H} & \\mathbf{C} \\ \\mathbf{L} \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{H} & \\mathbf{C} \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\ \\mathbf{L} \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\end{bmatrix}} \\mathbf{h}^{\\rm p} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{L} & \\ \\mathbf{h} \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{35}$$\n\nwhere h = H = H =H = (T ; ) ; in which H = represents the inhom ogenetty (bullk) averaged critical eld at which the critical current density extrapolates to zero. The m icrosopic based tem perature dependencies are selected for the upper critical eld ( 3) and the G L param eter (15).

Note that this approach signi cantly di ers from the usual separation between the dependence of the bulk pinning force on H , ( ) and H , ( ) . Here this is not assum ed a priori and strain dependency is simply introduced through a strain dependent upper critical eld and G L param eter. This relation will be com pared to m easurem ents in Section 3 to determ ine the constants and to test its validity.\n## 3. C om parison to m easurem ents\n\nIn this Section we will com pare the general Jc(H ;T;) relation [\\(36\\)](#page-17-0) to earlier experim entaldata.Experim entaldetails,aswellasthe existing data-setwere described elsewhere [4,10,107]. The selected data-set for the renewed analysis are Jc(H ;T;) resultswhich were m easured on an InternationalTherm onuclear Experim entalR eactor (ITER ) type, Furukawa bronze processed wire. A m ore detailed description of this wire is also given elsewhere [60]. The results ofthis wire are selected because ofthe dem onstrated high reproducibility, and since it was analyzed extensively in various laboratoriesaround theworld.Itshould beem phasized thattheresultsforthiswireare notunique,butrepresentative forthe scaling behaviorforatleast\f ve otherwiresfrom variousm anufacturers[4,9].Jc(H ;T)resultswereobtained on an ITER -typeTi-6A l-4V barrelat electric \f eld criteria ofE<sup>c</sup> = 10 <sup>5</sup> to 5 10<sup>4</sup> V=m . Jc(H ;T;) results were obtained on a Ti-6A l-4V U -shaped bending spring at E<sup>c</sup> = 5 10<sup>4</sup> V=m and on a Ti-6A l-4V circular bending spring ('Pacm an') at E<sup>c</sup> = 10 <sup>4</sup> V=m . The ITER barrel and U -shaped bending spring sam pleswere heattreated together,whereasthe Pacm an sam ple was heat treated separately. A lldata are corrected for resistive currents that run parallelto the superconductor at any voltage criterion and the self-\f eld generated by the wire isalso corrected for.These detailscan be found elsewhere [56].\n\nFirst the \f eld dependence willbe analyzed in detail. This results in the values for p and q in [\\(36\\)](#page-17-0),H c2(T) and Fp m ax(T). Then the tem perature dependence willbe analyzed in detailand itwillbeshown thatthe K ram er/Sum m ersform failsto describe the tem perature dependence by the use of = 2:5 and = 2 in [\\(36\\)](#page-17-0). The use ofthese constants results in a tem perature dependent variation of <sup>1</sup> thatissigni\f cantly larger than can be expected from the m icroscopic theory. N ext the im proved tem perature dependence, through the use of di erent values for and , willbe introduced and validated. This is followed by an analysis ofthe strain dependence using the im proved deviatoric strain m odel. By using correct values for and , it is not required to separate the tem perature and strain dependence ofthe bulk pinning force. A lso the strain dependenceofFp m ax isdeterm ined from them easurem ents.Finally,them inim um required data-setto determ ine the criticalsurface ofan unknown wire willbediscussed.\n\n## <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>3.1.

The right graph shows the reduced dependencies for the Jc(H ;T;) for all tem perature and strain values. The \f t values for Hc2(T) and Fp m ax(T) for the Jc(H ;T) m easurem ents are sum m arized in \f gur[e3,](#page-20-0) including a calculated dependence for H c2(T) using the M aki-D e G ennes relation [\\(12\\)](#page-8-0) with <sup>0</sup>H c2(0) = 30:1 T and T<sup>c</sup> (0) = 16:7 K . It should be noted that these are at 0:15% axial pre-com pression, as will be shown in Section [4.](#page-27-0) The high value for H c2(0) in com parison to a m easured m axim um detectable value <sup>0</sup>H c2(0) = 29:3 T [60]can be explained by inhom ogeneitiescausing a downward tailin K ram erplotsthereby resulting in an overestim ate ofthe extrapolated H c2(0). It should be em phasized that this high value isrequired to accurately describe the m easurem ents in the range h < 0:8.\n\nThebulk pinning forcecurvesin \f gur[e2](#page-19-0) dem onstratethatp = 0:5 and q= 2 indeed yield the correct m agnetic \f eld dependence for the entire investigated tem perature and strain regim e. A bove h = 0:8 deviations can occur, but these are attributed to inhom ogeneities. It should be em phasized that the observed correspondence with p = 0:5 and q = 2 is not speci\f c forthis wire,but holds forallour earlier investigated sam ple m aterialsand also for'norm ally'reacted PIT wires asdem onstrated by Cooley et al.[80]. N ote also that the regim e above h = 0:8 can be accounted for in the \f t by using deviating values forp and q. This willobviously lead to a di erent value for the scaling \f eld Hc2 and scaling,as dem onstrated by a norm alized pinning function,\n\n![](1__page_20_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>F igure 3.

This will in prove the accuracy of the t above h = 0 x at the ost of generality of the model. How ever, since this regim e involves very low current densities that are of negligible im portance to the applications, we choose to retain a generalm odel at the cost of low current density t accuracy.\n\nIt is thus concluded that the eld dependence is accurately described by p = 0.5 and q = 2 for all m agnetic elds in the range 0.05 < h < 0.8 for all temperatures and strains. It is also observed that the M aki+D e G ennes relation indeed yelds an accurate description for the tem perature dependence of the e estive upper critical eld resulting from transport critical current m easurem ents.\n\n## 3.2. Tem perature dependence\n\nThe temperature dependence of the bulk pinning force can now be analyzed. The tem perature dependencies for the upper critical eld and the G L param eter are known . T his means that only the tem perature dependence of the m axim um bulk pinning force has to be investigated to determ ine the overall tem perature dependence of the bulk pinning force.

The variation in 1 with tem perature, according to the K ram er/Summers form , can be calculated through (41) by using values for Fon ax (T ) and H 2 (T ) from gure 3, and by inserting a value for 1 (0). Choosing C = 12:8 10 AT 15 m 2 as proposed by K ram er (5), results through (40) in 1 (0) = 38:6; a reasonable value compared to the literature [69]. The resulting values for 1 (T ), calculated from Fpmax (T) and H , (T ) using (41) are plotted in gure4, together with the m icroscopic (15) and em pirical (11) dependencies.\n\nThe change of 1 (T) of nearly 100% is unrealistic, since a m axim um change of 20% is expected in the weak, and 50% in the strong coupling limit as discussed in Section 2 2. This is independent of the choice of C and thus 1 (0), since the calculations are norm alized to 1 (0). The combination of = 2.5 and == 2 therefore results in an\n\n![](1__page_22_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>F igure 5.

The large change in 1 w ith tem perature thus translates to a larger change in the slope of a K ram er plot at higher tem peratures. This is visualized by the K ram er plot given in gure5.\n\nThe overall J ; (H ; T ) least squares t is optimized at 4 2 K in this graph, to en phasize the deviations that occur at higher tom peratures. The error in the overall tem perature dependence in the K ram er/Sum m ers m odel, through the use of = 2 :5 and\n\n= 2, causes signi cant deviations in the slope of a K ram er plot at higher tem peratures and thus in large errors in the calculated J c (H ; T ) values.\n\nDeviations in the Kram er twere observed also in our earlier analysis [109,110] and were attributed to incorrect (em pirical) tem perature dependencies of the e ective upper critical eld and the GL param eter. Now that H.g (T ) and 1 (T ) are replaced by m icrosopic based altematives, it has to be concluded that the observable errors in F pm ax (T) stem from incorrect values for and . This is supported by the unrealistic large change in the calculated 1 with tem perature, surpassing the strong coupling limit.\n\n3.2.2. Im proved tem perature dependence In the above analysis it becam e clear that the tem perature dependence of the bulk pinning force using = 2.5 and = = 2 is incorrect. It is therefore required to determ ine the optim alvalues for both constants that yield the highest accuracy for the calculation of the tem perature dependence of the m axim um bulk pinning force.

The G L param eter now changes by about 35% which is in agreem ent with expectations (i.e. between 20 and 50% , see Section 2 2 3) and, m oreover, follow s the m icrosopic based description.

D i erences between the them al precom pression on the ITER barrel and the strain devices are attributed to the di erences in mounting tem perature of the wire (epoxy hardening at room tem perature for the ITER barrel versus soldering at about 200 C for the strain devices).\n\n# 5. D iscussion\n\n### 5.1. Scaling accuracy\n\nThrough system atic com parison with measured results de crencies in existing scaling relations can be highlighted. Im provem ents can, however, only be m ade em pirically through a change of the bulk pinning force dependency on both H ~ (T ) simultaneously. The resulting relation describes the measurem ents accurately (also for a multitude of other wires) [4,9]. The values = = 2 and = = 1 are similar to those found earlier [4,9,10] through m inim ization of the exror in the overall J. (H ; T ; ) least squares t. In the earlier analysis it was assum ed that the deviating values for and\n\noriginated from a w rong tem perature dependence of H c and 1 . It is now concluded that the Kram er form , which results from the Labusch [20] finction for C 66, is in fact not accurate. These theories have been questioned in the literature, speci cally by Brandt [21] and Dew Hughes [17], emphasizing the di culties in understanding and modeling the ux-line to pinning site interactions. A reasonable tem perature dependence description can be achieved for the combinations = 0.880 0.756, but the overallerror show s a distinct minim at = 2 and = = 1. For a proper connection to theory these values should result from a fundam ental form of these interactions. A t present, to our know ledge, such a m odel is not available.\n\n### A general scaling relation for N b3Sn\n\nThe validity of the new scaling relation was tested on a database derived from four samples, one of which was heat treated separately. The sam ples were characterized in three experim ental setups. D eriving a singular param eter set for the Furukawa w ire is complicated by sm all di erences between the sam ples and characterization methods. A better t to the U-spring strain results alone can, for example, be found by the use of slightly di erent param eters. This stem s from small, for now unclear, di erences between the separate samples and experiments. Ideally all measurem ents should be perform ed on a single instrum ent and on a single wire and at one single, low criterion. T he latter is preferred to rem ove inaccuracies arising from parasitic current subtraction and for consistency with the more standard criterion of E = 10 ° V =m . Nevertheless, the accuracy of a very sim ilar function (using the earlier deviatoric strain model) was investigated extensively in previous work and it was concluded that a standard deviation below 2% can be obtained [2]. The applicability of the proposed scaling function was validated for Internal-T in w ires during the ITER bendim ark tests in our earlier work [9], and in unpublished analysis of Powder-in-Tube w ires.\n\n# 5.2. M inim um required dataset\n\nW ith a scaling relation available the question arises as to what is the minimum data-set that is needed to retrieve the entire critical surface. For the tem perature dependence two H , (T ) points are required to determ ine the entire H , (T ) dependence through the M D G relation. These should be determ ined by transport J7 m easurem ents since these yield the correct H 2 and T . required for scaling. From gures it is seen that preferably at both ends of the tem perature range the slope of the K ram er plot has to be determ ined to extrapolate to H ¸ (T ) . T his is m ost simply done by a J . (H ) m easurem ent at 4 2 K at a few m agnetic eld values to check for linearity and thus validate the choice of q = 2. In addition this should be done at a higher temperature, e.g. 12 K m ight be a good com prom ise between tem perature range and available m agnetic eld in a laboratory m acret. Non-linearities above h = 0.8 should be neglected since they m ost probably result from inhom ogenetties. The results can then be extrapolated linearly in a K ram er plot to yield H ¿ (42 K ) and H ¿ (12 K ) . The M D G relation (or its approxim ation) then yields H & (0; = m ) and T (0; = m ). Je (0;T; = m ) and C1 are known through (47) using a least squares t to the J data set.\n\nThe strain dependence can then be determ ined by a 4.2 K strain m easurem ent with sı cient strain resolution to accurately determ ine the mechanical param eters (e.g. as in gure 9). The magnetic eld for the strain characterization should preferably be chosen such, that over the entire strain range of interest, the critical current rem ans above about 10 A to avoid inaccuracies at low current measurem ents. A com parison to the J . (H ; 4 2 K ) results above will yield m and H ~m (0) and T = (0) can be calculated. The entire critical surface up to the m agnetic eld where inhom ogenety e ects start to appear (i.e. h = 0.8) is then known. The characterizations should preferably be done using one sample and one instrum ent to avoid experim ental errors. The required\n\n# A generalscaling relation for N b3Sn 31\n\ndata-setcan thus be sum m arized asfollows:\n\n- (i) A n Ic(H ) m easurem ent at 4.2 K from about 5 T up to the m axim um available m agnetic \f eld (see \f gu[re8\\)](#page-25-0),preferably 12 to 15 T.\n- (ii) A n Ic(H ) m easurem ent at about 12 K from 1 T or as low as possible,up to the m axim um available m agnetic \f eld.

C onclusions\n\nA new,generally valid scaling relation is proposed which is based on a K ram er type pinning description.A num berofim provem entsarem adein com parison to theSum m ers form .

A third im provem ent is m ade by replacing the power-law strain dependency with a new em piricaldeviatoric strain description that accounts for the e ects of the third strain invariant and thus for asym m etry in the axial stain dependency curve.

This results in a generally valid m agnetic \f eld dependence ofthe K ram erform ,i.e.F<sup>p</sup> / h <sup>0</sup>:<sup>5</sup>(1 h) <sup>2</sup> within the range 0:05 < h < 0:8.\n\nThrough theanalysisofthem agnetic\f eld and tem peraturedependence ofthebulk pinning force itisshown thatthe K ram er/Sum m ersform ,i.e.F<sup>p</sup> / [H c2(T)]<sup>2</sup>:<sup>5</sup>=1(T) 2, fails to describe the observed tem perature dependence with su cient accuracy. The earlier suggestion that this followed from an em pirical tem perature dependence of the upper critical \f eld and the G L constant was contradicted through the use of m icroscopic based relations for both. The change in <sup>1</sup>(T) in the K ram er/Sum m ers form is signi\f cantly larger than 50% as is expected from m icroscopic theory in the strong coupling lim it.

It is suggested that the tem perature dependence of C 66 as given by Labusch needs to be reevaluated.\n\n32\n\nThe new temperature dependence of the bulk pinning force allows for an unam biguous introduction of the strain dependence of the bulk pinning force, w thout the need to include separate finctions to describe the strain dependent upper critical\n\neld and tem perature dependent upper critical eld, as is usually done in the literature. The measurem ents indicate that the G inzburg-Landau param eter has sim ilar strain dependence as the upper critical eld.\n\nThe in proved deviatoric strain model, which includes asym metry, yields an accurate description ofm easured behavior. Though em pirical, it is based on conclusions resulting from more fundam ental approaches and it recognizes the three dim ensional nature of strain .\n\n### A cknow ledgm ents\n\nThis work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scienti c Research (NW O ) through the Technology Foundation STW and by the D irector, O ce of Science, 0 ce ofFusion Energy Sciences, ofthe U.S.Department of Energy under Contract DE -A C 02-05C H 11231 .

        "abstract": "We review the scaling relations for the critical current density (J<SUB>c</SUB>) in Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn wires and include recent findings on the variation of the upper critical field (H<SUB>c2</SUB>) with temperature (T) and A15 composition. Measurements of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) in inevitably inhomogeneous wires, as well as analysis of literature results, have shown that all available H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) data can be accurately described by a single relation from the microscopic theory. This relation also holds for inhomogeneity averaged, effective, H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(T) results and can be approximated by H_{\\mathrm {c2}}(t)/H_{\\mathrm {c2}}(0) \\cong <P />1-t^{1.52} , with t = T/T<SUB>c</SUB>. Knowing H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(T) implies that J<SUB>c</SUB>(T) is also known. We highlight deficiencies in the Summers/Ekin relations, which are not able to account for the correct J<SUB>c</SUB>(T) dependence. Available J<SUB>c</SUB>(H) results indicate that the magnetic field dependence for all wires from \\mu_0H \\cong <P />1 T up to about 80% of the maximum H<SUB>c2</SUB> can be described with Kramer's flux shear model, if nonlinearities in Kramer plots when approaching the maximum H<SUB>c2</SUB> are attributed to A15 inhomogeneities. The strain (epsi) dependence is introduced through a temperature and strain dependent H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(T,epsi) and Ginzburg Landau (GL) parameter κ<SUB>1</SUB>(T,epsi) and a strain dependent critical temperature T<SUB>c</SUB>(epsi). This is more consistent than the usual Ekin unification of strain and temperature dependence, which uses two separate and different dependences on H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(T) and H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(epsi). Using a correct temperature dependence and accounting for the A15 inhomogeneities leads to the remarkably simple relation J_{\\mathrm {c}}(H,T,\\epsilon)\\cong (C/\\mu <P />_0H)s(\\epsilon) (1-t^{1.52})\\allowbreak (1-t^2)h^{0.5}(1-h)^2 , where C is a constant, s(epsi) represents the normalized strain dependence of H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(0) and h = H/H<SUB>c2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(T,epsi). Finally, a new relation for s(epsi) is proposed, which is an asymmetric version of our earlier deviatoric strain model and based on the first, second and third strain invariants. The new scaling relation solves a number of much debated issues with respect to J<SUB>c</SUB> scaling in Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn and is therefore of importance to the applied community, who use scaling relations to analyse magnet performance from wire results.",
