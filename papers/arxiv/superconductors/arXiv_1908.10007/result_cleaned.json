China\n\n<span id=\"page-0-0\"></span>Abstract. We report the effect of Nb doping on the upper critical field of the cubic Laves-phase superconductor HfV<sup>2</sup> studied in a series of HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 under pulsed fields up to 30 T. The undoped HfV<sup>2</sup> undergoes a martensitic structural transition around 110 K, and becomes superconducting below T<sup>c</sup> = 9.4 K. Upon Nb doping, while the structural transition is suppressed for x ≥ 0.1, a maximum in T<sup>c</sup> of 10.1 K and zero-temperature upper critical field Bc2(0) of 22.4 T is found at x = 0.2, which is ascribed to an increase of the density of states at the Fermi level. For all samples, the temperature dependence of Bc2 can be well described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory that takes into account both the spin paramagnetic effect and spin orbit scattering. In addition, a comparison is made between the Bc2 behavior of HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> and those of Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nHfV<sup>2</sup> based superconductors with the C15 cubic Laves-phase structure have received considerable attention because of their potential as high-field superconducting magnets [\\[1,](#page-6-0) [2\\]](#page-6-1). Similar to A15-type Nb3Sn, HfV<sup>2</sup> undergoes a martensitic transition involving two successive structural modifications from cubic to tetragonal then to orthorhombic in the temperature range between 100 to 115 K [\\[3\\]](#page-6-2), followed by a superconducting transition below T<sup>c</sup> ∼ 9 K [\\[4\\]](#page-6-3). Despite its relatively low Tc, the upper critical field Bc2 of HfV<sup>2</sup> has been found to be ∼20 T at 4.2 K, and can be improved to ∼23 T by alloying with ZrV<sup>2</sup> [\\[5\\]](#page-6-4), which is the highest for superconductors composed only of transition metal elements. Furthermore, compared with Nb3Sn, the HfV2-based C15 compounds are more resistant to neutron radiation [\\[6\\]](#page-6-5) and less brittle [\\[7\\]](#page-6-6), which make them promising for application in nuclear fusion reactor.\n\nFor superconductors with spin-singlet Cooper pairs, superconductivity(SC) can be destroyed by the application of magnetic field via two effects. The first one is the orbit effect, which is a manifestation of the Lorentz force. The second one is the spin paramagnetic effect, which tends to align the spin of Cooper pairs and can be partially cancelled out by introducing the spin-orbit scattering. The investigation of the Bc2 has been shown to provide valuable information on the contributions from these effects [\\[8,](#page-6-7) [9,](#page-6-8) [10\\]](#page-6-9). In the case of Hf1−xZrxV2, the Bc2 value was measured across 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, by only at 4.2 K [\\[5\\]](#page-6-4). In addition to Zr, various other dopants, such as Ta [\\[11\\]](#page-6-10), Nb [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11), Fe [\\[13\\]](#page-6-12), Co [\\[13\\]](#page-6-12), Ni [\\[13\\]](#page-6-12), have been introduced in the HfV<sup>2</sup> system to investigate the impurity effect on superconductivity and structural transition. For example, dilute Nb doping (≤ 5%) is found to suppress the structural transition and increase T<sup>c</sup> [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11). However, no systematic study on the temperature and doping dependencies of Bc2 has been reported for any of these dopants.\n\nIn this paper, we present a study on the superconducting properties of HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> for x in the range of 0 to 0.3, focusing on the Bc2(T) behavior. Bulk SC with indication of strong coupling nature is observed in this x range, and a maximum T<sup>c</sup> of 10.1 K is found at x = 0.2. The Bc2(T) data for all x values are well fitted by the WHH model including the effects of spin paramagnetism and spin orbit scattering. The extrapolated Bc2(0) exhibits a maximum of 22.4 T also at x = 0.2, which is 4.1 T higher than that of undoped HfV2. The enhancement of both T<sup>c</sup> and Bc2(0) is attributed to an enhanced density of states of the Fermi level [N(EF)], as revealed by the specific heat results. We also compare the Bc2(T) curve at the optimal doping with those of Nb0.44Ti0.<sup>56</sup> and Nb3Sn, and discuss its implication on the Bc2 improvement.\n\n## 2. Experimental details\n\nPolycrystalline HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 were prepared by the arc-melting method. High purity Hf slugs (>99.9%), V (>99.99%, 200 mesh) and Nb (>99.99%, 200 mesh) powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio and Enhancement of the upper critical field in the cubic Laves-phase superconductor HfV<sup>2</sup> by Nb doping3\n\nmelted in an arc furnace under high-purity argon atmosphere. The melts were turned over and remelted by the same procedure several times to ensure homogeneity, following by rapid cooling on a water-chilled copper plate. The samples were used as cast without further annealing treatment, which was reported to result in T<sup>c</sup> degradation [\\[14\\]](#page-6-13). The phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance x-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. The chemical composition of theses samples was examined with an energy-dispersive xray (EDX) spectrometer (Model Octane Plus) affiliated to a Zeiss Supratm 55 schottky field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The spectra were collected on at least 3 different locations of each sample for averaging. The electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe method. Resistivity and specific heat measurements down to 1.8 K and up to 9 T were carried out on regular-shaped samples in a Quantum Design PPMS-9 Dynacool. The magnetoresistance under pulsed fields up to 30 T was measured at the National High Magnetic Field Center in Wuhan. The dc magnetization measurements down to 1.8 K were performed using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Desgin MPMS3).\n\n## 3. Results and Discussion\n\nFigure 1(a) shows the room-temperature XRD patterns for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples. All the major peaks can be indexed on the cubic C15 structure with the space group Fd3m [\\[3\\]](#page-6-2), and a schematic structure is shown in Fig. 1(b). The lattice parameter, determined by a least-squares method, is plotted as a function of the nominal Nb content x in Fig. 1(c). For undoped HfV<sup>2</sup> (x = 0), the refined a = 7.382 ˚A is in good agreement with the previous reports [\\[3,](#page-6-2) [4\\]](#page-6-3). In this compound, the V atoms form a network of corner sharing tetrahedron, and the nearest V-V distance dV−<sup>V</sup> = 2.616 ˚A is even smaller than that (2.620 ˚A) in body-center-cubic (BCC) V. With increasing x, the a-axis expands monotonically to 7.399 ˚A. This is in line with the expectation that Nb substitutes V rather than Hf since r(V) < r(Nb)< r(Hf), where r is the atomic radius. In addition to the main C15 phase, there exist small extra diffraction peaks, which is ascribed to the Hf-based solid solution impurity. Base on the peak intensity at <sup>∼</sup>36.7◦ (marked by the asterisks), the impurity fraction is estimated to vary from ∼8% to ∼12%, depending on the Nb content. On the other hand, the chemical compositions of these samples measured by EDX are HfV2.04(5), HfV1.88(3)Nb0.12(2), HfV1.7(1)Nb0.20(4), and HfV1.67(2)Nb0.35(3), which agree with the nominal ones considering both the measurement error and impurity level.\n\nFigure 2(a) shows the low temperature resistivity for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples. A resistive superconducting transition is observed for all the samples. For HfV<sup>2</sup> (x = 0), the transition starts at ∼9.6 K and the transition width is about 0.4 K. In addition, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), a resistivity bump due to the structural phase transition is clearly visible at ∼110 K. Upon Nb doping, the resistive transition sharpens considerably. The T<sup>c</sup> values, determined as midpoint temperatures of the resistive transitions, are 9.4 K, 9.88 K, 10.1 K, and 9.84 K for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The occurrence of SC in these HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples is corroborated by the magnetic susceptibility results shown in Fig. 2(b). For each x, a strong diamagnetic signal is detected, and its onset temperature corresponds well to the midpoint of the resistive transition except for x = 0, where the onset temperature coincides with the completion of the resistive transition. When cooling below 9 K, all the zero-field cooling susceptibility curves become flat, and the shielding fractions are calculated to vary between 110% and 150% without correction for the demagnetization effect.\n\nThe main panel of Fig. 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat Cp/T for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples. A C<sup>p</sup> anomaly can be seen at ∼110 K for HfV2, in accordance with the martensitic structural transformation. However, the small magnitude and relatively broad width of this anomaly signify that the structural transition is of second order rather than first order [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11). This is probably because that our sample is slightly off stoichiometric, and, indeed, its T<sup>M</sup> ≈ 110 K is slightly lower than that the usual value of 116 K [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11). For x ≥ 0.1, no such anomaly is discernible. This indicates that the structural transformation is suppressed completely by this Nb doping level, in line with the previous study [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11). On the other hand, a sharp C<sup>p</sup> jump around T<sup>c</sup> is found for all samples, which can be seen more clearly from the Cp/T versus T <sup>2</sup> plot shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). This confirms the bulk nature of SC in these HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples. Following Ref. [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11), the normal-state data are analyzed by the Debye model Cp/T = γ<sup>e</sup> + β3T <sup>2</sup> + β5T <sup>4</sup> + β7T 6 , where γ<sup>e</sup> and β<sup>i</sup> (i = 3, 5, 7) are the electronic and phonon specific heat coefficients, respectively. Here the high order terms are included since there is a downward curvature of the data. The best fits yield γ<sup>e</sup> = 50 mJmol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>K<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , 65 mJmol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>K<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , 68 mJmol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>K<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , and 62 mJmol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>K<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively, which are comparable to the previous study [\\[12\\]](#page-6-11). Since γ<sup>e</sup> is proportional to N(EF), these results not only indicate a large N(EF) in HfV2−xNbx[\\[15\\]](#page-6-14), but also point to an increase of N(EF) by Nb doping.\n\nFigure 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the normalized electronic specific heat Cel/γeT after subtraction of the phonon contribution. The normalized specific heat jumps ∆Cel/γeT<sup>c</sup> for these samples are about 1.7, which are significantly larger than the value 1.43 of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [\\[16\\]](#page-6-15) and point to a strong coupling superconducting state. In such case, the Cel/γeT jump can be analyzed by a modified BCS model, or the so called \"α model\", where α = ∆0/T<sup>c</sup> and ∆<sup>0</sup> is the size of fully isotropic gap at 0 K [\\[17\\]](#page-6-16). It turn out that the data of x = 0 can be well reproduced with ∆0/T<sup>c</sup> = 2, which is very close to that reported previously [\\[18\\]](#page-6-17) and indeed larger than the BCS value of 1.764. For Nb-doped samples, the data almost overlap with each other and can be better fitted with ∆0/T<sup>c</sup> = 2.25 for T/T<sup>c</sup> ≤ 0.6. Nevertheless, at higher T/Tc, a discrepancy exists between the experimental and theoretical results, which is probably due to either the error in the estimation of phonon specific heat contribution or the existence of gap anisotropy.\n\nTo obtain Bc2(T) for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples, temperature dependent resistivity measurements at constant fields up 9 T (in PPMS) are combined with isothermal magnetoresistance measurements under pulsed fields up to 30 T. Examples for x = 0.2 are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively, and the suppression of SC with increasing field is evident in both cases. For consistency, the value of T<sup>c</sup> (Bc2) in each curve is determined as the onset temperature (field) of the resistive transition, and the resulting Bc2−T phase diagrams are displayed in Fig. 4(c). The initial slopes of Bc2(T), (dBc2/dT)<sup>T</sup> <sup>=</sup>T<sup>c</sup> , are found to be −5.1 T/K, −6.0 T/K, −6.0 T/K, and −5.4 T/K for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively, which are typical for HfV<sup>2</sup> based superconductors [\\[18\\]](#page-6-17).\n\nAccording to the WHH theory [\\[8\\]](#page-6-7), the zero-temperature orbital upper critical field Borb c2 (0) in the dirty limit is given by\n\n$$B\\_{c2}^{\\text{orb}}(0) = -0.693 (dB\\_{c2}/dT)\\_{T=T\\_{\\text{c}}} T\\_{\\text{c}}.\\tag{1}$$\n\nUsing this formula, the calculated Borb c2 (0) for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples falls between 33.2 to 41.9 T, which is much higher than the estimated Bc2(0) ∼ 20 T. This indicates that the spin paramagnetic effect is at work, and hence the Cooper pairs are in the spin singlet state. Note that the paramagnetically limiting field B<sup>P</sup> c2(0) can be expressed as\n\n$$B\\_{c2}^{\\rm P}(0) = B\\_{c2}^{\\rm orb}(0) / \\sqrt{1 + \\alpha\\_{\\rm M}^2},\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere α<sup>M</sup> = √ 2Borb c2 (0)/BP(0) is the Maki parameter and BP(0) is the Pauli limiting field at 0 K [\\[9\\]](#page-6-8). Since BP(0) = ∆0/ √ 2µB, where µ<sup>B</sup> is the Bohr magneton, the α<sup>M</sup> values are found to be 2.38, 2.47, 2.47, and 2.31 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. Then B<sup>P</sup> c2(0) are estimated to be in the range from 12.9−15.7 T, significantly smaller than the experimental values. Clearly, spin-orbit scattering that counteracts the spin paramagnetic effect needs also to be considered.\n\nIt is known that the Bc2(T) of a type-II superconductor in the dirty limit can be calculated from the the linearized Gor'kov equation, with spin paramagnetic effect and spin-orbit scattering parameterized as α<sup>M</sup> and λso [\\[10\\]](#page-6-9). The equation is expressed by a sum of digamma functions as:\n\n$$\\ln\\frac{1}{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\lambda\\_{\\mathrm{so}}}{4\\gamma}\\right)\\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\bar{\\mathrm{h}} + \\lambda\\_{\\mathrm{so}}/2 + \\mathrm{i}\\gamma}{2\\mathrm{t}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\lambda\\_{\\mathrm{so}}}{4\\gamma}\\right)\\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\bar{\\mathrm{h}} + \\lambda\\_{\\mathrm{so}}/2 - \\mathrm{i}\\gamma}{2\\mathrm{t}}\\right) - \\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right), (3)$$\n  $\\text{where } t = T/T\\_c, \\gamma \\equiv [(\\alpha\\_{\\mathrm{M}}\\bar{\\mathrm{h}})^2 \\text{-} (\\lambda\\_{\\mathrm{so}}/2)^2]^{1/2}, \\text{ and}$  \n$$\\bar{h} = \\frac{4B\\_{c2}}{\\bar{h} - \\underline{\\mathrm{h}}} \\tag{4}$$\n\n$$\\bar{h} = \\frac{4B\\_{c2}}{\\pi^2 (-dB\\_{c2}/dt)\\_{t=1}} \\tag{4}$$\n\nThe normalized upper critical field h <sup>∗</sup> = (π <sup>2</sup>/4)h¯ for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples with <sup>x</sup> <sup>≤</sup> 0.3 is plotted against t in Fig. 5. As can be seen, all the data points are well fitted only when both α<sup>M</sup> and λso are nonzero, which are summarized in Table 1. Actually, the theoretical curves concerning only the orbital effect (α<sup>M</sup> = 0, λso = 0) fit the data close to T<sup>c</sup> well but strongly overestimate Bc2(T) at low temperature. By contrast, the fitting curves with λso = 0 underestimate the Bc2(T) data for most of the t range. These results not only demonstrate conclusively the presence of spin orbit scattering, but also underline the importance of low temperature data in the analysis of Bc2(T) behavior for HfV<sup>2</sup> based superconductors [\\[18\\]](#page-6-17).\n\n## Enhancement of the upper critical field in the cubic Laves-phase superconductor HfV<sup>2</sup> by Nb doping6\n\nTo gain more insight, the values of Tc, Bc2(0), γe, α<sup>M</sup> and λso from the above results are plotted as a function of the Nb content in Fig. 6. It turns out that all of Tc, Bc2(0) and γ<sup>e</sup> follow a nonmonotonic x dependence with a maximum at x = 0.2, hinting at a close relation between them, while no obvious feature is seen in the data of α<sup>M</sup> and λso. In particular, compared with undoped HfV2, the Bc2(0) value is 4.1 T (∼22%) larger at x = 0.2, which is remarkable since T<sup>c</sup> is increased only by 0.7 K (∼7%). For strong coupling superconductors, their T<sup>c</sup> is given by the MaMillan formula [\\[19\\]](#page-6-18)\n\n$$T\\_c = \\frac{\\Theta\\_\\text{D}}{1.45} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1.04(1+\\lambda)}{\\lambda - \\mu^\\*(1+0.62\\lambda)}\\right],\\tag{5}$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{N(E\\_\\mathcal{F}) \\langle I^2 \\rangle}{M \\langle \\omega^2 \\rangle},\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhere Θ<sup>D</sup> is the Debye temperature, µ ∗ is the Coulomb pseudopotential, hI 2 i is the average square electron-ion matric element, M is the atomic mass, and hω 2 i is the average square phonon frequency. Hence one could see that T<sup>c</sup> increases with increasing N(EF), which explains the enhancement of T<sup>c</sup> by Nb doping. On the other hand, it is noted from Fig.5 that the h <sup>∗</sup> values at 0 K are very similar for the HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> samples. It thus appears that Bc2(0) is nearly proportional to the product of T<sup>c</sup> and (dBc2/dT)<sup>T</sup> <sup>=</sup>T<sup>c</sup> . In the dirty limit, we have (dBc2/dT)<sup>T</sup> <sup>=</sup>T<sup>c</sup> ∝ γeρc, where ρ<sup>c</sup> is the resistivity value just above T<sup>c</sup> [\\[20\\]](#page-7-0). Given that γ<sup>e</sup> increases by more than 30% with increasing x from 0 to 0.2, it can be speculated that the concomitant enhancement of Bc2(0) is also mainly due to an enhanced N(EF).\n\nFinally, we present in Fig. 7 a comparison between the Bc2-T phase diagrams of HfV1.8Nb0.2, Nb0.44Ti0.<sup>56</sup> [\\[21\\]](#page-7-1), and Nb3Sn [\\[22\\]](#page-7-2), all of which adopt the cubic structure but with different space groups (Table 2). It is noted that the Bc2(T) curve of HfV1.8Nb0.<sup>2</sup> lies between those of Nb0.44Ti0.<sup>56</sup> and Nb3Sn. In particular, the Bc2(0) value of HfV1.8Nb0.<sup>2</sup> is much higher than that of Nb0.44Ti0.56, despite their similar Tc. This substantiates that C15 HfV2-based superconductors hold the record Bc2(0) for compounds composed only of transition metal elements. Furthermore, as can be seen from Table 2, Bc2(0) already approaches its orbital-limited value for Nb0.44Ti0.<sup>56</sup> and Nb3Sn. By contrast, given its relatively small λso, there is still plenty room for the Bc2(0) enhancement of HfV1.8Nb0.2. Indeed, assuming the same λso = 4.5 as Nb0.44Ti0.56, Bc2(0) of HfV1.8Nb0.<sup>2</sup> would reach ∼33 T, which is even higher than that of Nb3Sn. In this respect, it is worthy noting the following two relations: λso = 2~/3πkBTcτso [\\[10\\]](#page-6-9) and τ0/τso = (Z/137)<sup>4</sup> [\\[23\\]](#page-7-3), where τso is the spin orbit scattering time, τ<sup>0</sup> is the transport lifetime and Z is the atomic number. Hence, doping with high Z elements, such as 4d or 5d elements, may increase λso and will be of interest for future studies.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we have studied the superconducting properties, with focus on the upper critical field, of polycrytalline C15-type Laves phase compound HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> with x up to 0.3. While the martensitic structural transition is suppressed for x ≥ 0.1, a maximum in T<sup>c</sup> (= 10.1 K) as well as Bc2(0) (= 23.1 T) is found at x = 0.2. Furthermore, the specific heat results indicate a strong coupling SC in the whole x range studied, and an increase of N(EF) induced by Nb doping, which is suggested to be responsible for the enhancement of both T<sup>c</sup> and Bc2(0). The Bc2(T) data of all samples are found to be well described by the WHH model considering the spin paramagnetic effect and spin orbit scattering. In addition, a comparison between the Bc2(T) behavior of HfV2−xNb<sup>x</sup> and those of Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn signifies the importance of spin orbit scattering in the Bc2(0) improvement for the former case. Our results call for further studies to increase the density of states at the Fermi level and spin orbit scattering in the HfV<sup>2</sup> based Laves-phase superconductors, which may facilitate the high-field application of these materials.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Yong Sun for his assistance in the data fitting.

        "abstract": "We report the effect of Nb doping on the upper critical field of the cubic Laves-phase superconductor HfV<SUB>2</SUB> studied in a series of HfV<SUB>2-x</SUB>Nb<SUB>x</SUB> samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 under pulsed fields up to 30 T. The undoped HfV<SUB>2</SUB> undergoes a martensitic structural transition around 110 K, and becomes superconducting below T<SUB>c</SUB> = 9.4 K. Upon Nb doping, while the structural transition is suppressed for x ≥ 0.1, a maximum in T<SUB>c</SUB> of 10.1 K and zero-temperature upper critical field B<SUB>c2</SUB>(0) of 22.4 T is found at x = 0.2, which is ascribed to an increase of the density of states at the Fermi level. For all samples, the temperature dependence of B<SUB>c2</SUB> can be well described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory that takes into account both the spin paramagnetic effect and spin orbit scattering. In addition, a comparison is made between the B<SUB>c2</SUB> behavior of HfV<SUB>2-x</SUB>Nb<SUB>x</SUB> and those of Nb-Ti and Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn.",
