However, to date there have been only a limited number of studies of the formation of SC V3Si thin films and the associated structural and superconducting properties. This work aims to explore the structural characteristics and SC properties of V3Si films, paving the way for the development of functional SC devices for quantum technology applications. We have investigated the formation of V3Si films by directly depositing vanadium (V) onto thermally grown SiO<sup>2</sup> on Si, followed by high-vacuum annealing to induce the phase transformation into V3Si. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry(RBS) was employed throughout the sample growth process to analyze the material composition as a function of depth using a <sup>4</sup>He<sup>+</sup> ion beam. Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully reacted with the SiO<sup>2</sup> substrate to form V3Si at the interface, in addition to a vanadium oxide (VO*x*) layer forming atop the V3Si film. The thickness of the V3Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing temperatures between 750°C and 800°C. A sharp SC transition was observed at T*<sup>c</sup>* <sup>=</sup> 13 K in the sample annealed at 750°C, with a narrow transition width (∆*Tc*) of 0.6 K. Initial reactive ion etching (RIE) studies yielded promising results for local removal of the (VO*x*) to facilitate electrical contact formation to the SC layer.\n\n*Keywords:* V3Si, Phase transformation, Superconductivity, Critical temperature\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nOver the past decade, A15 structure SC materials have gained significant attention due to their relatively high SC transition temperatures, [\\[1\\]](#page-6-0) and efforts have been made to fabricate Josephson devices from materials such as Nb3Sn, [\\[2\\]](#page-6-1) and Nb3Ge [\\[3\\]](#page-6-2). Vanadium silicide, V3Si, is an example of an A15 structure SC material, first discovered by Hardy and Hulm in 1954, with a critical temperature (T*c*) of 17.1 K. [\\[4\\]](#page-6-3) As a silicide, V3Si is compatible with existing silicon technology [\\[5,](#page-6-4) [6\\]](#page-6-5) and possesses the highest T*<sup>c</sup>* among other silicides, making it an attractive material for the development of silicon-based SC devices. Notably, since it has an s-wave pairing symmetry and isotropic energy gap, it is an excellent candidate for use in devices like Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). [\\[7,](#page-6-6) [8\\]](#page-6-7)\n\nV3Si film can be formed using a phase reaction technique, in which V metal is deposited directly onto Si or SiO2/Si substrates using various deposition methods, such as electron beam evaporation [\\[9,](#page-6-8) [10\\]](#page-6-9), magnetron sputtering [\\[11,](#page-6-10) [12\\]](#page-6-11), or molecular beam epitaxy [\\[6\\]](#page-6-5) followed by annealing under optimal conditions. Annealing V/Si films, where V is directly deposited on Si, usually results in the formation of VSi2, which is not a SC material.[\\[9,](#page-6-8) [13,](#page-6-12) [14\\]](#page-6-13) However, Zhang et al. [\\[15\\]](#page-6-14) have recently demonstrated the formation of V3Si by depositing V onto a 20 nm thick top layer of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, with the layer thickness of V being chosen to approximately match the amount needed to give the the correct stoichiometry of V3Si in the fully transformed film. Following heat treatment at specific conditions, the V3Si formed leaving a thin residual layer of unreacted V layer at the surface.\n\nIn the case of V/SiO2/Si film formation, where V is deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate, the formation of V3Si phase initiates at a somewhat higher threshold temperature than is the case for direct reaction of V with Si. In both cases, annealing to form the SC phase must be carried out in a high vacuum environment.[\\[9,](#page-6-8) [13,](#page-6-12) [14,](#page-6-13) [16,](#page-6-15) [17\\]](#page-6-16) Compared to V/Si films, the diffusion rate of Si in V/SiO2/Si films is lower because the Si source originates from SiO2, which must first undergo decomposition before diffusion can occur. Thus, during the annealing of V/SiO2/Si films, two key processes are expected to take place: (i) the decomposition of SiO<sup>2</sup> and (ii) the subsequent interaction of the dissociated Si and O with V, leading to the formation of V3Si beneath a VO*<sup>x</sup>* surface layer.[\\[10,](#page-6-9) [14,](#page-6-13) [17\\]](#page-6-16)\n\nIn this report, we present our preliminary results on the fabrication of SC devices; mainly, the formation of SC V3Si thin films on thermally grown SiO<sup>2</sup> on Si, achieved through interfacial reaction and phase transformation. The results include RBS analysis for compositional and structural characterization, optical micrograph analysis of the sample's surface, and lowtemperature four-terminal resistance measurements to investigate the SC behavior of the V3Si thin film. Furthermore, we report the progress on the application of reactive ion etching (RIE) to remove the phase-transformed VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer, to expose\n\n<sup>∗</sup> Jeffrey McCallum.

Thin film fabrication\n\nIn this study, we synthesized V3Si through the phase transformation of V/SiO2/Si films. V/SiO2/Si films were prepared as follows: First, a 230 nm thick SiO<sup>2</sup> layer was grown by thermally oxidizing a Si wafer in a dry oxygen ambient at 1000°C for 5 hours and 15 minutes. The Si wafer was thoroughly cleaned using Piranha/RCA2/HF to remove any contaminants and native SiO<sup>2</sup> prior to oxidation. Finally, a 300 nm thick V layer was deposited onto the 230 nm thick SiO2/Si using an electron beam evaporation system with a base pressure of about 1 × 10−<sup>7</sup> Torr. V is very reactive at elevated temperatures[\\[18\\]](#page-6-17) and usually requires annealing to be performed under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. Therefore, we employed an in-house developed annealing technique utilizing high vacuum electron beam annealer (HVEBA) equipped with a disappearing-filament pyrometer, and a graphite box crucible, as shown in Figure [1\\(](#page-2-0)e). The Sample was enclosed in a graphite box, within the EBA chamber, which was heated by the electron beam. The temperature of the sample was monitored with a pyrometer from outside of the chamber. Figure [1\\(](#page-2-0)a-d) shows the process employed to synthesize V3Si films. The process begins with preparing a Si substrate from a cleaned Si wafer (Figure [1a](#page-2-0)), followed by the thermal growth of a SiO<sup>2</sup> layer (Figure [1b](#page-2-0)). V is then deposited onto the SiO2/Si substrate (Figure [1c](#page-2-0)), and finally, the sample is annealed to induce the formation of V3Si (Figure [1d](#page-2-0)). Thin film samples were annealed at 750 °C or 800 °C for 30 minutes to form a layered structure consisting of a residual layer of unreacted SiO<sup>2</sup> with a thickness that depends on the duration of the anneal, the V3Si layer formed by the reaction process and an overlayer of VO*<sup>x</sup>* arising from diffusion of oxygen from the V3Si/SiO<sup>2</sup> reaction boundary toward the surface.\n\n# 3. Results and discussions\n\n# *3.1. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry analysis (RBS)*\n\nRBS using a MeV <sup>4</sup>He ions was employed to study the identity of the elements present in the sample and their composition as a function of depth. Here, we provide a brief overview of the technique's principles related to our study. A full description of the technique is provided in Ref.[\\[19\\]](#page-6-18). The energy of ions backscattered from elements at the sample surface is determined by their atomic mass. Ions backscattered from elements at the surface of the sample possess higher energy than those backscattered from elements deeper within the sample. This is due to the electronic stopping within the sample. Consequently, the thickness of a layer in the sample can be related with the energy width of the backscattered ions from that layer. Hence, the energy spectrum gives information about both the mass and the depth of the elements.\n\nThe concentration or yield in RBS is proportional to the square of the atomic number (*Z* 2 ), making the technique less sensitive to light elements. This sensitivity decreases further when light element signals overlap with background signals from heavier elements. In our study, this limitation is particularly evident when detecting impurities such as carbon (C) and oxygen (O). For instance, in the phase-transformed VO*<sup>x</sup>* films shown in Figure 2b and 2c, the O signal appears broad and suppressed by the strong V background, which further diminishes the detectability of O.\n\n# *3.2. RBS results*\n\nWe conducted RBS analysis on several samples during and after the synthesis of V3Si thin films, that is on the as-deposited V film (V/SiO2/Si) and samples annealed at 750 °C and 800 °C for 30 minutes. RUMP RBS analysis [\\[20\\]](#page-6-19) was used to simulate and fit the experimental RBS data, for quantitative analysis of the elemental composition and thickness, as well as spectral interpretation.\n\nFigure 2a displays the RBS spectra of the as-deposited V sample, showing signals from all relevant elements. The V spectrum is observed in the channel range of 320–400, and the Si signal is represented by two edges: one at the higher energy level (marked as 1), which corresponds to the top Si face on the SiO<sup>2</sup> layer, and the other at the lower energy level (marked as 2), which corresponds to the Si from the Si sustrate/ SiO<sup>2</sup> interface. The signal, marked as \"O/SiO2\", corresponds to the O spectrum from the SiO<sup>2</sup> layer. The simulated (SIM) spectrum (shown in red) fits well the experimental (EXP) spectrum (in black), with the SIM data being presented in the table below Figure 2a. The thicknesses for the V and SiO<sup>2</sup> layers align well with the expected deposited V and the thermally grown SiO<sup>2</sup> thickness layer. Figure 2b and c show the RBS spectra of samples annealed at 750°C and 800°C for 30 minutes, respectively. In both figures, the simulated spectra (red) closely match the experimental spectra (black), apart from a deviation in the near-surface region of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* in Figure 2c which we have not tried to fit because we are not concerned with the exact composition of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* film with depth. In the 750°C annealed sample (Figure 2b), a V3Si layer approximately 63 nm thick forms beneath a 300 nm thick VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer. The SiO<sup>2</sup> layer also decreases in thickness from 230 nm to 170 nm, indicating the consumption of Si and O for the formation of V3Si and VO*x*. These changes are more pronounced in the 800°C annealed sample (Figure 2c). The higher annealing temperature enhances V diffusion and accelerates SiO<sup>2</sup> decomposition, leading to thicker V3Si and VO*<sup>x</sup>* layers. Quantitative RBS analysis of this 800°C annealed sample reveals that the V3Si layer grows to about 130 nm, the VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer reaches ∼ 315 nm, and the residual SiO<sup>2</sup> layer is reduced to ∼ 75 nm. Overlay of the EXP spectra of the as-deposited (black) and 750°C-annealed (red) samples in Figure 2d highlights three key observations: I. A decrease in the yield of the vanadium (V) signal (marked as 1a) and the broadening of its spectrum (marked as 1b) associated with V diffusion into the Si/SiO<sup>2</sup> substrate, forming V3Si at the interface of the SiO<sup>2</sup> layer. II. The reduced yield of the Si signal (marked as 2a) and the step formation towards the V spectrum (marked as 2b) indicate Si reaction with V, forming V3Si. III. The O profile of the SiO<sup>2</sup> layer shows a reduction in yield at its higher energy levels (marked as 3a), and a broader peak (marked as\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n(e) Setup diagram of UHV pyrometer-equipped electron beam annealing system\n\nFigure 1: V3Si thin film fabrication process.

The sharp decline in the V signal yield (marked as 1a) further supports the formation of VO*x*, consistent with V readily forming oxide compounds.[\\[9\\]](#page-6-8)\n\n# *3.3. Low temperature electrical resistance measurement*\n\nResistance measurements using the four-probe method in a van der Pauw (VDP) configuration were conducted on the V3Si thin film annealed at 750°C to examine its temperaturedependent electrical behaviour. The results, shown in Figure 3a, demonstrate that the sample exhibits a sharp SC transition, with a *T<sup>c</sup>* of 13 K. The steep resistance drop near the SC transition results in a narrow transition width of <sup>∆</sup>*T<sup>c</sup>* <sup>=</sup> <sup>0</sup>.6 K. This suggests a high degree of homogeneity of the V3Si thin film. and a good interconnection between the polycrystalline grains of the SC thin film in agreement with previous studies.[\\[21,](#page-6-20) [22\\]](#page-6-21)\n\nHaving successfully formed V3Si thin films on thermally grown SiO2/Si substrates and demonstrated their SC properties,we proceeded to fabricate SC patterned wires for applications such as quantum computing. Using standard photolithography techniques, we patterned wires with widths ranging from <sup>5</sup> µm to 200 µm, processing them under conditions similar to those used for the thin films. However, electrical contacts to the SC layer that functioned at low temperature could not be reliably formed in the patterned devices and it was considered that this may be due to the presence of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* overlayer.\n\n# *3.4. E*ff*ect of VO<sup>x</sup> on the Superconducting Layer*\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether the vanadium oxide (VO*x*) formed at the surface layer is responsible for insulating the electrical contact to the V3Si in the case of patterned wires. However, studies have shown that annealing V/SiO2/Si films pro-\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n# (a) Asdeposited-V film (b) Annealed @ 750°C\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n| LAYER | THICKNESS | COMPOSITION           |\n|-------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| 1     | 280 nm    | V 1 : O 0.5 : Si 0.02 |\n| 2     | 63 nm     | V 3 : Si 1            |\n| 3     | 170 nm    | O 2 : Si 1            |\n| ব     | 1500 nm   | Si 1                  |\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: RBS spectra of the V/SiO2/Si samples analyzed using RUMP software, showing signals of the possible elements in the sample as a function of depth: (a) Spectra of the as-deposited V/SiO2/Si film.

For example, VO<sup>2</sup> undergoes a metal-insulator transition (MIT) at approximately 341 K, transitioning from a metallic to an insulating state as the temperature decreases.[\\[23\\]](#page-6-22) Interestingly, oxygen-deficient VO2−*<sup>x</sup>* films have been observed to maintain metallic conductivity even at temperatures as low as 1.8 K, effectively suppressing the MIT.[\\[24,](#page-6-23) [25\\]](#page-6-24) Furthermore, V4O7[\\[26\\]](#page-6-25) and V6O11[\\[27\\]](#page-6-26), known as the Magneli phases (denoted as ´ V*n*O2*n*−1) of VO*<sup>x</sup>* compounds[\\[28\\]](#page-6-27), exhibit intriguing electrical properties due to their mixed metallic and semiconducting nature. Specifically, these compounds can display metallic conductivity even at cryogenic temperatures. In contrast, phases with higher oxygen content, such as V2O5, are known to be insulating at low temperature.[\\[29,](#page-6-28) [30\\]](#page-6-29) Even the VO<sup>2</sup> exhibits insulating behavior around the SC transition temperature of V3Si.\n\nWhile the larger contact pads used for the VDP structures on the laterally uniform thin films did reliably allow low temperature electrical characterisation of the SC transition, the smaller scale of the pads on the patterned devices resulted in variability in behaviour from contact to contact and it was surmised that local grain structure and compositional variation of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer could be responsible for this issue.\n\nTherefore, we decided to investigate the removal of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer to expose the V3Si phase. In this study, we used RIE to etch away the VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer. The preliminary results of this process are discussed in the next section.\n\n# 4. Reactive ion etching of VO*<sup>x</sup>* film layer\n\nRIE is a technique that utilizes chemically reactive plasma to etch specific materials. Research has shown that adjusting parameters such as radio frequency (RF) power, gas composition, and pressure, the etch rate and selectivity for VO*<sup>x</sup>* films can effectively control the etch rate and selectivity for VO*<sup>x</sup>* films, achieving rates of over 74 nm/min.[\\[31,](#page-6-30) [32\\]](#page-6-31) However, unlike these VO*<sup>x</sup>* films which are grown by deposition, our VO*<sup>x</sup>* films are phase-transformed and sitting on a SC V3Si layer. With the goal of selectively etching VO*<sup>x</sup>* while leaving the V3Si layer intact, a careful and gradual etching process is required to preserve the integrity of the underlying V3Si layer and RBS provides a convenient tool for studying the etch process and to identify any compositional changes that may accompany the process.\n\nIn our RIE experiment, a mixture of Ar/Cl<sup>2</sup> gases, was employed to remove the VO*<sup>x</sup>* overlayer. In this process, a 4 × 4 mm<sup>2</sup> , 800 °C-annealed thin film sample, consisting of a VO*x*/V3Si/SiO2/Si multilayer structure, were patterned into two rectangular shapes with dimensions of 1.7 mm × 0.6 mm and 1.7 mm × 0.4 mm. This patterning was achieved using direct laser writing (DLW) after the sample was coated with approximately 3 µm of Ti-35E photoresist (PR). The operating parameters included a total gas pressure of 5 mTorr, an input ICP power of 1500 W, a bias power (RIE power) of 200 W, and a total gas flow rate of 40 sccm, with varying etching durations. The Cl2/Ar mixing ratio was maintained at 25% Cl<sup>2</sup> and 75% Ar by adjusting the partial flow rates of each component. The bottom electrode temperature was stabilized at 14 °C using a water-cooled system. Etch depths were measured using a stylus profilometer (Bruker Dektak XT).\n\nAn optical micrograph of the etched and unetched regions of the 800°C-annealed V/SiO2/Si sample in Figure 3b displays a smooth surface, indicating a uniformly etched surface and the granular structure in the etched region is associated with the residual VO*<sup>x</sup>* as confirmed by the RBS analysis in Figure 3d. RBS analysis was performed on both the etched and unetched regions of the sample (see Figure 3c-e), and profilometer measurements were used to further analyse the etched depth (Figure f).\n\nFigure 3c displays the RBS analysis of the unetched region of the 800 °C-annealed sample, which corresponds to the data presented in Figure 2c. The results presented in the table show that a 130 nm V3Si phase is formed underneath ∼ 315 nm VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer. Figure 3d illustrates the RBS spectra analysis of the etched region, with the SIM plot (red) closely matching the experimental data (black). The analysis shows that approximately 95 nm thick of VO*<sup>x</sup>* remains at the surface layer, and this reflects the oxide layer being reduced by about 208 nm after the 6-minute RIE etching. Overlaying the RBS spectra of the etched (red plot) and unetched (black plot) regions of the 800 °C-annealed sample shown in Figure 3e, demonstrates the reduction of the VO*<sup>x</sup>* layer from both the V and O spectral regions. Profilometer measurements of the 800 °C-annealed thin film sample showed that 208 ± 5 nm of depth was etched after 6 minutes, closely matching the RBS analysis. A slower etching rate was targeted to avoid rapid etching into the V3Si layer. Figure 3f presents the RIE etching rate of VO*<sup>x</sup>* films from similarly processed samples, showing a consistent rate of 34.<sup>51</sup> <sup>±</sup> <sup>0</sup>.39 nm/min. This demonstrates good process control, which is crucial for the next phase of the project—fabricating V3Si devices from these films.\n\nThese initial test results are encouraging and support the continuation of this approach to fully etch the VO*<sup>x</sup>* while maintaining the integrity of the underlying V3Si layer.\n\n# 5. Conclusions and outlooks\n\nV3Si SC thin films were fabricated by electron beam evaporation of V onto a thermally grown SiO2/Si substrate, followed by HVEBA. A sharp resistivity drop and a complete SC transition were observed with a T*<sup>c</sup>* of 13 K for the sample annealed at 750°C. The thickness and composition of the multilayer thin film were studied using RBS analysis.\n\nRIE was used to remove the phase-transformed VO*<sup>x</sup>* surface layer, exposing the V3Si layer as a step toward the creation of functional patterned SC devices.\n\nWith further tuning of the RIE parameters we expect that it will be possible to reliably making electrical contacts to the SC thin film layer allowing reliable construction of patterned devices and providing a pathway for development of functional SC V3Si thin film devices including Josephson junctions and SC resonators.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by an Australian Research Council (ARC) grant (DP200103233).

However, to date there have been only a limited number of studies of the formation of SC V\\(_3\\)Si thin films and the associated structural and superconducting properties. This work aims to explore the structural characteristics and SC properties of V\\(_3\\)Si films, paving the way for the development of functional SC devices for quantum technology applications. We have investigated the formation of V\\(_3\\)Si films by directly depositing vanadium (V) onto thermally grown SiO\\(_2\\) on Si, followed by high-vacuum annealing to induce the phase transformation into V\\(_3\\)Si. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry(RBS) was employed throughout the sample growth process to analyze the material composition as a function of depth using a 4He+ ion beam. Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully reacted with the SiO\\(_2\\) substrate to form V\\(_3\\)Si at the interface, in addition to a vanadium oxide (VO\\(_x\\)) layer forming atop the V\\(_3\\)Si film. The thickness of the V\\(_3\\)Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing temperatures between 750\\(^{\\circ}\\)C and 800\\(^{\\circ}\\)C. A sharp SC transition was observed at T\\(_c\\) = 13 K in the sample annealed at 750°C, with a narrow transition width (\\(\\Delta T_c\\)) of 0.6 K. Initial reactive ion etching (RIE) studies yielded promising results for local removal of the VO\\(_x\\) to facilitate electrical contact formation to the SC layer.",
