T he achievable transport current density in w ires depends on the A 15 com position,m orphology and strain state. T he A 15 sections in w ires contain,due to com positionalinhom ogeneities resulting from solid state diusion A 15 form ation reactions,a distribution ofsuperconducting properties. T he A 15 grain size can be dierentfrom w ire to w ire and is also not necessarily hom ogeneous across the A 15 regions. Strain is always present in com posite w ires,and the strain state changes as a result oftherm alcontraction dierences and Lorentz forces in m agnet system s. To optim ize the transport properties itis thusrequired to identify how com position,grain size and strain state in\nuence the superconducting properties. T his is not accurately possible in inhom ogeneousand spatially com plex system ssuch asw ires.T hisarticle therefore givesan overview ofthe available literature on sim pli\fed,wellde\fned (quasi-)hom ogeneouslaboratory sam ples. A fter m ore than 50 years ofresearch on superconductivity in N b3Sn,a signi\fcant am ount ofresults are available,but these are scattered over a m ultitude ofpublications. T wo review s exist on the basic properties of A 15 m aterials in general,but no speci\fc review for N b3Sn is available. T his article is intended to provide such an overview . It starts w ith a basic description of the N iobium -T in interm etallic.

Ever since its discovery,the m aterialhas received substantial attention due to its possibility to carry very large currentdensitiesfarbeyond thelim itsofthecom m only used N bT i. It has regained interest over the past decade due to the generalrecognition that N bT i,the com m unities' present workhorse for large scale applications, is operating close to its intrinsic lim its and thus exhausted for future application upgrades. N b3Sn approxim ately doubles the available \feld-tem perature regim e w ith respect to N bT iand isthe only superconducting alternativethat can be considered suciently developed for large scale applications.\n\nInterm etallic N iobium -T in is based on the superconductor N b, w hich exists in a bcc N b structure (T<sup>c</sup> = 9:2 K ), or a m etastable N b3N b A 15 structure (T<sup>c</sup> =\n\n5:2 K ) [\\[4](#page-12-3)[,5](#page-12-4)]. W hen alloyed w ith Sn and in therm odynam ic equilibrium ,it can form either N b<sup>1</sup> Sn (about 0:18 0:25) or the line com pounds N b6Sn<sup>5</sup> and N bSn<sup>2</sup> according to the generally accepted binary phase diagram by C harlesworth et al.[\\[6\\]](#page-12-5)(\fgure [1\\)](#page-1-0).

It can be form ed either above 930 C in the presence ofa Sn-N b m elt,orbelow thistem perature by solid state reactionsbetween N b and N b6Sn<sup>5</sup> orN bSn2.Som e investigations suggest that the nucleation of higher Sn interm etallics is energetically m ore favorable for lower form ation tem peratures [\\[11](#page-12-10)[,12,](#page-12-11)[13](#page-12-12)[,14](#page-12-13)[,15,](#page-12-14)[16\\]](#page-12-15).

V A R IA T IO N S IN LA T T IC E P R O P E R T IE S\n\nVariations in superconducting properties of the A 15 phase are throughoutthe literature related to variations in the lattice properties through the lattice param eter (a),atom ic Sn content ( ),the norm alstate resistivity just above T<sup>c</sup> ( <sup>n</sup>) or the long range order (LRO ).T he lattercan bede\fned quantitatively in term softheBragg-W illiam s order param etersS<sup>a</sup> and S<sup>b</sup> for the chain sites and the cubic sites respectively.

A t the stoichiom etric com position S = S<sup>a</sup> = S<sup>b</sup> = 1 and S = 0 represents com plete disorder. Q ualitatively,the m ore generalterm 'disorder'is used for the LRO since any type of disorder(e.g.quenched in therm aldisorder,o-stoichiom etry, neutron irradiation) reduces T<sup>c</sup> [\\[28](#page-12-27)]. A review of the literature suggests that the aforem entioned lattice variables (a, and S) and <sup>n</sup> are,at least qualitatively,interlinked throughout the A 15 phase com position range.

A ffer Flukiger, it represents a collection of results from D evantay et al. [11], O rlando et al. [33, 34] and a close to stoichiom etric single crystal from A rko et al. [39]. The dotted line in the plot separates the cubic and tetragonal phases at 24.5 at.% Sn. The Foner and M dV i results in gure 7 are, in contrast to Flukiger's collection, here separated in the cubic and the tetragonal phase with assum ed identical com position . The com position that was used here was taken from the Flukiger collection, which showed a single of H c2 point at a value of about 27 T (the average between the cubic and tetragonal phase). It is unclear where this com positional value is attributed to or w hether the cubic single crystal in fact has a lower Sn content.\n\nIn addition to the results collected by Flukiger also recent H c2 ( ) m easurem ents from Jew ell et al. [12] are added. A slightly di erent route was followed than given in [12] for the analysis of the H c2 (T ) results. The com positions of the hom ogenized bulk sam ples in [12] were calculated from the To values assum ing a linear Tc ( ) dependence as given by (9). The resulting H c2 ( ) using these com positions is linear and deviates from the collection by Flukiger, as shown in [12]. Here, the com positions were recalculated based on the Tc values using the Boltzm ann t on the Devantay et al. results as given\n\nby (10). The Jew ell et al. bulk results then becom e consistent with the earlier H c2 ( ) data. The highest value of 31.4 T represented, although extrapolated [12], a record for binary N b-Sn, but has very recently been surpassed by an (extrapolated) disordered bulk sam ples [40]. The existing H cc ( ) data can be summ arized by a summ ation of an exponential and a linear t according to:\n\n<span id=\"page-5-2\"></span>\n$$\\text{a } ^\\text{0}\\text{H}^\\text{ }\\text{c}^\\text{ }\\text{\\(\\)} = \\begin{array}{c} \\text{10} \\quad \\text{b} \\quad \\text{exp} \\quad \\overline{\\text{b} \\text{c}^\\text{ }} \\text{\\(\\text{00}\\text{348}\\text{\\(\\)}\\text{)} + \\text{577} \\quad \\text{107} \\text{\\(\\text{11}\\)} \\end{array}$$\n\nThe solid curve in the right graph in gure 7 is calculated using (11). It is interesting to note that a linear extrapolation of the cubic H c2 ( ) results yields around 35 T for the stoichiom etric com position, in agreem ent with the reported record value by Cooley et al. [40]. Unfortunately, how ever, com positional inform ation is not available for this bulk sample, a high degree of uncertainty is stated for their reported resistivity value of 300 cm , and the corresponding To value of 15.1 K would place the Sn content around 23% .

That this value is lower than the calculated 22 value of 29 cm (from T c) can be attributed to inaccuracies in voltage tap separation length which were about 30% and/or percolation of the measuring current. These results are in qualitative agreem ent with the thin Im data of O rlando et al. in the previous section, i.e. the eld-tem perature phase boundary increases dram atically ifthe A 15 Sn content is increased. The shift of the boundary with composition appears proportional, ie. without the tilt that occurred in the Orlando et al. results between the low resistivity and optim al dirty thin m . A gain, the shape of the phase boundary is independent of com position.\n\n### D . Concluding rem arks\n\nThe three H c2 (T ) data sets on de ned laboratory sam ples are highly consistent. Bulk sam ple m aterials are arguably the closest representation of A 15 layers in w ires. More experim ents on bulk m aterials w ill therefore be welcom e to clarify the inconsistency between the Tc ( ) data sets of M oore et al. and Devantay et al. and to generate a larger quantity and m ore accurate H c2 ( ) database using the these days readily available high eld m agnet system s. The existing data can be summ arized by plotting their extrem es [H c2 (0) and Tc (0) ] as finction of com position as was done in qure 7. This is valid since the shape of the phase boundary is constant and independent of com position (and thus independent of the electron phonon interaction strength), or whether the m aterial is in the cubic or the tetragonal phase [52, 53].

GRAIN SIZE AND THE MAXIMUM BULK PINNING FORCE\n\nA 15 N b-Sn behaves as a T ype-II superconductor. Its current carrying capabilities for any practical eld (above oH c1 = 38 mT [38]) thus rely on its capability to pin the ux-lines. The bulk pinning force at Je can be calculated from its critical balance with the Lorentz force:\n\n<span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>\n\nThe bulk pinning force depends on them agnetic eld and m ostly has a m axim um which is positioned roughly between 0.1 to 0:4H c2 [81, 82]. The m agnetic eld value at w hich the m axim um occurs depends on the details of the\n\nux-line to lattice interactions [41, 81, 83]. From (13) it is clear that the bulk pinning force determ ines the conductors' current carrying capabilities. The general assum ption is that the grain boundaries in the A 15 phase represent the prim ary pinning centers. This is supported by strong experim entalevidence in which them axim um pinning force is related to the reciprocal grain size and thus the grain boundary density [84, 85, 86, 87, 88]. These results were summ arized by Fischer [89], who also obtained additional results for the maxim um bulk pinning force versus grain size from V SM characterizations. A reproduction after Fischer, including his own additions is shown in gure 10. It rem ains unresolved how grain boundary pinning in Nb3 Sn occurs in detail. It is obvious that mim a are present in the superconducting w ave function at the grain boundaries but it is unclear what physical principle (the presence of C u, m orphology, etc.) constitutes to this. Investigating what is present at the grain boundary m ight resolve som e of this question and recent e orts are m ade in this respect [90].\n\nThe calculated value for F2 from transport current depends on the area for Je, which can be norm alized to e.g. the non-Cu area or the A 15 area. M ost pinning force data from the literature are calculated from the non-Cu Jo and gure 10 show s that all pre-2002 results are consistent. They follow a single line on a sem i-logarithm ic plot sum m arized w ith :\n\n$$\\text{F}\\_{\\text{P=max}} = 22.7 \\text{ h} \\quad \\frac{1}{\\text{d}\\_{\\text{vv}}} \\qquad 10 \\quad ^{\\text{h}} \\text{G N=m} ^{\\text{g}}; \\qquad \\text{(14)}$$\n\nin which day represents the average grain size in m. A dditionally them axim um bulk pinning force data from F ischer, calculated from V SM derived non-C u J values are included in the graph (black squares). These results approxim ately correspond to the earlier literature data. If, how ever, the values obtained by Fischer are calculated from Jo values which are norm alized to the A 15 area, the calculated maximum pinning force becom es higher due to the increased Jo values. The slope in the sem ilogarithm ic plot e ectively increases and Fischer's A 15 area results can thus be sum m arized by :\n\n$$\\text{IF}\\_{\\text{P\\\\_max}} = \\text{ 39.2 } \\text{h} \\quad \\frac{1}{\\text{d}\\_{\\text{av}}} \\qquad \\text{ 10 } \\quad ^{\\text{h}} \\text{G N} \\text{=} ^{\\text{g}} ; \\tag{15}$$\n\n![](0__page_9_Figure_10.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>FIG . 10: Maxim um pinning force as finction of reciprocal grain size after Fischer [89].

The e ective pinning force can be interpreted as a m easure of the e ective pinning strength of a grain boundary. Calculation of (16), how ever, requires an accurate determ ination of G B =A which, although thoroughly analyzed by F ischer [89], is offen not available.\n\nThe optim um grain size to achieve the ideal lim it of one pinning site per ux-line can be estimated, since the grain boundaries are the prim ary pinning centers in N b3Sn. This lim it will be approached if the grain size is comparable to the ux-line spacing at a given eld. The ux-line spacing can be calculated by assum ing a trianqular ux-line lattice [80]:\n\nwhich results in 14 nm at 12 T . The smallest grain sizes in gure 10 are about 35 nm but comm ercial wires have grain sizes of 100 to 200 nm and are thus far from opti m ized. In NbT i in contrast, the ideal limit of one uxline per pinning site has been closely approached through\n\nspeci c heat treatm ents that introduce a ne distribution of norm al conducting alpha-T iprecipitates that act as pinning sites [91]. NbT i is therefore (under present understanding) close to fully optim ized.\n\nV TIT SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES W ITH STRAIN\n\n### A . M icroscopic origins of strain dependence\n\nThe superconducting properties of allm aterials are to a certain extent sensitive to strain, although the e ect can be m arginal as for exam ple for N bT i. The strain inuences on the critical current in the N b-Sn system originate from shifts in the eld-tem perature phase boundary, ie. Je varies through a change in H c2 (T ) and possibly a direct in uence on the maxim um bulk pinning force, as is detailed elsewhere [82]. Strain in uences can be separated into two regim es. O bviously, large strain can evoke serious and irreversible dam age to the superconductor in the form of cracks in the brittle A 15 m aterial [92]. Low er strain can vary the superconducting properties through strain induced lattice instabilities that result in a tetragonal distortion [93, 94] and by in uencing the electronelectron interactions, which can both be reversible. The latter can, in the case of A 15 N b-Sn, be discussed in tem s of lattice distortions that in uence the Nb chain integrity and thus N (E = ), or in term s of changes in lattice vibration modes which in uence the electron-phonon interaction spectrum [which includes changes in N (Er )].\n\nSince distorting the lattice will modify N (Er ), it can be argued that the net e ect is similar to an increase in the am ount of disorder. This would render strain effects to be qualitatively sim ilar to irradiation dam age, or also similar to Sn de ciency if n (S) ( gure 4) and n ( ) ( gure 5) can be considered of identical origin (section II) . Snead and Suenaga [95] have perform ed irradiation experim ents on A 15 lam ents w ith and w ithout prestrain and concluded that irradiation increases the e ect of prestrain on T.. This supports the above hypothesis, since the fact that pre-strain and irradiation am plify each other could imply that these e ects are based on a sim ilar microscopic principle [ie. a modi cation of N (E r ) ]. Reversing this line of thought it can be argued that increasing the am ount of disorder in a highly ordered system will have a relatively larger e ect on its superconducting properties com pared to a system which is already substantially disordered. Flukiger et al. collected strain sensitivity data of the critical current for various A 15 w ires with a varying degree of ordering and suggested to attribute changes in strain sensitivity to the degree of ordering [26]. H is collection is reproduced in gure 11. Speci cally, when comparing Nb3Sn (S = 1) and N b3A 1 (Sg = 0:95), the latter being always decidedly o stoichiom etric due to the instability of the stoichiom etric phase at lower tem peratures, the di erences are large,\n\n![](0__page_10_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>FIG . 11: Strain sensitivity of the critical current for di erent A 15 superconductors with varying am ounts of disorder after Flukiger et al. [26] .\n\ny d 984 P lenum P ress. A dapted with kind perm ission of Springer Science and Business M edia and R . F lukiger.\n\ndespite roughly comparable H c2 and To values. If the above argum ent is correct, it can be expected that strain sensitivity of the A 15 N b-Sn system depends on com position. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that in axial strain experim ents on w ires, the strain sensitivity of the critical current increases with increasing m agnetic eld or tem perature (see e.g. [82] and the references therein). A t higherm agnetic eld and tem perature, the lower Sn A 15 fractions are no longer superconducting. W th increasing m agnetic eld or tem perature, the observed strain dependence is m ore and m ore determ ined by the higher Sn A 15 fractions in the wires. These results therefore also represent a suggestion for enhanced strain sensitivity at higher Sn content. W hether this indeed is true is im portant for practical applications, since the present trend to im prove the perform ance of comm ercial w ires by Sn enrichm ent in the A 15 could lead to an undesired increased strain sensitivity.\n\nStrain sensitivity in terms of variations in electronphonon interaction strength can be explained within the weak coupling BCS theory and also in the more general E liashberg form alism by a pressure dependence of Tc (0) [96]. How ever, strong indications exist throughout the literature that hydrostatic strain has only a negligible in uence in comparison to non-hydrostatic or distortional strain com ponents [96, 97, 98]. Follow ing these initial publications, which were based on strong coupling renorm alized BCS theory, a recent attempt has been made to couple a microscopic full strain invariant analysis to E liashberg-based relations for the critical tem perature through strain-induced m odi cations in the electron-phonon spectrum [99, 100, 101]. This analysis is discussed in m ore detail elsew here [53, 82]. These recent descriptions are based on To variation through a change in the electron-phonon interaction constant by a change in the lattice vibration m odes. The latter is m odeled by\n\nstrain induced m odi\fcationsto the frequency dependent electron-phonon interaction (in w hich N (E<sup>F</sup> )isim plicit) and phonon D O S.T hese m odelswereveri\fed using literature results forT<sup>c</sup> versus hydrostatic strain on a single crystaland T<sup>c</sup> versus axialstrain on w ires and tapes. It should be em phasized, however, that for a precise description of the strain in\nuences also the strain dependence ofH c2(T)should be correlated to the m icroscopic theory.\n\nStrain induced changes in N (E<sup>F</sup> ) in the fullinvariant analysis for T<sup>c</sup> are only accounted for through a strainm odi\fed frequency dependence of the electron-phonon interaction,i.e. the change in N (E<sup>F</sup> ) is not directly calculated, but this apparently yields sucient accuracy. Fora m icroscopicdescription ofthe strain dependence of H c2(T),however,the exactchange in N (E<sup>F</sup> )w ith strain should be know n,asisevidentfrom [\\(12\\)](#page-8-0).T hisdirectin uence ofa change in N (E <sup>F</sup> )on H c2(0)would hypothetically resultin a higherstrain sensitivity forH c2(0)com pared to Tc(0). T his is veri\fed by experim entalresults w herethe relativestrain dependence ofH c2(0)isroughly a factor 3 tim es higher than for Tc(0) (see e.g.[\\[82\\]](#page-13-33)and the references therein). T his enhanced strain sensitivity ofH c2(0) com pared to Tc(0)was notsatisfactory explained using strong coupling corrected BC S theory [\\[98\\]](#page-14-3). Prom ising recentwork by O h and K im [\\[102\\]](#page-14-7),thatutilizes the interaction strength independent Eliashberg theory, yields a m ore satisfactory explanation,although preferably this should be com bined w ith M arkiew icz's his full invariantanalysisto arrive at a com plete description for the strain dependence ofthe superconducting properties ofN b3Sn.\n\n# B .

W ires are, however, due to their fabrication processes, always decidedly inhom ogeneous in com position as wellas strain. T he foregoing discussions on the possible m icroscopic origins of strain dependence em phasized the need for strain dependence results, obtained from sam ples w ith a \fxed and know n com position, since both com position and strain in\nuence H c2(T). R esults on laboratory specim en w ith de\fned com position are lim ited to hydrostatic experim ents on single crystals or polycrystalline layers (e.g. [\\[21,](#page-12-5) [104](#page-14-9)]) and one uniaxial experim ent, also on a single crystal [\\[105](#page-14-10)]. T hese result in dTc=dP = 0:14 and 0:22 K /G Pa for a single crystal[\\[21\\]](#page-12-5)and a polycrystallinelayer[\\[104](#page-14-9)]respectively.O ne result exists for the pressure dependence ofH c2 on an inhom ogeneous tape conductor [\\[96](#page-14-1)], w hich resulted in d <sup>0</sup>H c2=dP = 1:2 0:2 T /G Pa.\n\nN ext to inhom ogeneities, also the three dim ensionality of strain com plicates the analysis in w ires. Ten H aken [\\[96\\]](#page-14-1) m ade attem pts to overcom e this problem by sw itching to deform ation experim ents on two dim ensional tape conductors. A lthough this has resulted in m any new experim entalinsights that em phasize the im portance ofnon-hydrostatic strain com ponents,the tape conductors used in his research stillsuered from com positionalim perfections.\n\nT he lack of extensive strain experim ents on wellde \fned laboratory sam ples thus lim its the ability to develop a description for T<sup>c</sup> and H c2 [or m ore speci\fcally H c2(T)]versusstrain,due to the possible dierentstrain sensitivity w ith com position. Such results are,however, required to accurately analyze w ire behavior. T he data setsneeded forthiswould preferably be analyzed in sim pli\fed m odel sam ples for w hich the three dim ensional strain can be calculated and w hich separate the strain dependencies for wellde\fned com positions.\n\n# IX . C O N C LU SIO N S\n\nSuperconductivity in the A 15 N b-Sn interm etallic is m icroscopically well described in general term s of electron-phonon coupling of C ooper pairs. Strong coupling corrections to the m icroscopic theory becom e necessary above 23 at.% Sn. Below this concentration the m aterialis weak coupling. T he A 15 lattice contains N b chainsin w hich the atom sare closely spaced resulting in an increased density of states around the Ferm i level, w hich is believed to be the m ain origin for the high criticaltem perature. T he binary phase diagram is well established although a preference for the form ation of close to stoichiom etric A 15 can be argued. Eects of o-stoichiom etry can be discussed in term soflattice param eter, long range ordering, resistivity or atom ic Sn content. T hese term s are equivalent and consistent behavior is observed throughout the literature. T he \feldtem peraturephaseboundary variessubstantially w ith Sn content,but the observations can be explained in term s ofo-stoichiom etry and the occurrence ofthe tetragonal phasecloseto stoichiom etry.T hedependence ofthe criticaltem peratureand uppercritical\feld on com positional variations varies only in detailthroughoutthe literature and iswellestablished forthebinary system .T hisconsistent behavior arguably also rem ains valid w hen ternary additions such as C u,T iorTa are present.\n\nC onsistent ternary or quaternary phase diagram s are not available but the pure binary phase diagram can be used,atleastqualitatively forthe A 15 phase,to describe com positional variations in higher order system s. T he\n\naddition of Cu allows for lower tem perature A 15 form ation. It is present at A 15 grain boundaries but does not appear to exist in the A 15 grains. Additions of T i and T a occupy N b sites and apparently result in distortions of the Nb chain integrity, cause o stoichiom etry, increase the resistivity and prevent the low tem perature tetragonaltransform ation .\n\nAbundant and consistent data on the bulk pinning force as function of reciprocal average grain size represent solid experim ental evidence that the grain boundaries are the m ain pinning centers. The exact mechanism that determ ines the pinning strength at the grain boundaries rem ains unresolved. A consistent relation em erges between the maximum bulk pinning force, calculated from the critical current density norm alized to the non-Cu area, and the average grain size. This maxim um bulk pinning force, com bined with the eld tem perature phase boundary and strain e ects, determ ines the attainable critical current density.\n\nThe in uence of hydrostatic deform ations can be qualitatively predicted from m icroscopic theory and lim ited data from hydrostatic deform ation experim ents are available. D istortional (non-hydrostatic) deform ations, how ever, dom inate the strain sensitivity. A lthough deform ation experim ents on w ires are abundant, no general statem ents can be m ade. This is due to the lack of nonhydrostatic deform ation experim ents on hom ogeneous,\n\n#### A cknow ledgm ents\n\nM ost ofthem aterialin this article was collected for the introduction chapters of m y PhD thesis during m y stay at the Applied Superconductivity Center, University of W isconsin-M adison, U.SA and at the Low Temperature D ivision, the Special Chair for Industrial Application of Superconductivity at the Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.

        "abstract": "Significant efforts can be found throughout the literature to optimize the current-carrying capacity of Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn superconducting wires. The achievable transport current density in wires depends on the A15 composition, morphology and strain state. The A15 sections in wires contain, due to compositional inhomogeneities resulting from solid-state diffusion A15 formation reactions, a distribution of superconducting properties. The A15 grain size can be different from wire to wire, and is also not necessarily homogeneous across the A15 regions. Strain is always present in composite wires, and the strain state changes as a result of thermal contraction differences and Lorentz forces in magnet systems. To optimize the transport properties, it is thus required to identify how composition, grain size and strain state influence the superconducting properties. This is not possible accurately in inhomogeneous and spatially complex systems such as wires. This article therefore gives an overview of the available literature on simplified, well-defined (quasi-)homogeneous laboratory samples. After more than 50 years of research on superconductivity in Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn, a significant amount of results are available, but these are scattered over a multitude of publications. Two reviews exist on the basic properties of A15 materials in general, but no specific review for Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn is available. This article is intended to provide such an overview. It starts with a basic description of the niobium-tin intermetallic. After that, it maps the influence of Sn content on the electron-phonon interaction strength and on the field-temperature phase boundary. The literature on the influence of Cu, Ti and Ta additions will then be summarized briefly. This is followed by a review of the effects of grain size and strain. The article concludes with a summary of the main results.",
