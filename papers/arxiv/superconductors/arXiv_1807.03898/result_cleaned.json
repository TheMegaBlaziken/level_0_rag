Epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on a Nb substrate is found and four types of orientation relationships (ORs) at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface are identified by electron diffraction or high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) analyses. Thin Nb3Sn grains are observed in regions with a low Sn flux and they have a specific OR: Nb3Sn (12̅0)//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (01̅1). The Nb3Sn/Nb interface of thin grains has a large lattice mismatch, 12.3%, between Nb (01̅1) and Nb3Sn (002) and a high density of misfit dislocations as observed by HR-STEM. Based on our microstructural analyses of the thin grains, we conclude that the thin regions are probably a result of a slow interfacial migration with this particular OR. The Sn-deficient regions are seen to form initially at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface and remain in the grains due to the slow diffusion of Sn in bulk Nb3Sn. The formation of Sn-deficient regions and the effects of interfacial energies on the formation of Sn-deficient regions at different interfaces are estimated by first-principles calculations. The finding of ORs at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface provides important information about the formation of imperfections in Nb3Sn coatings, such as large thin-regions and Sn-deficient regions, which are critical to the performance of Nb3Sn SRF cavities for accelerators.\n\n**Keywords:** Nb3Sn; defects; orientation relationship; superconducting; transmission electron microscopy\n\n#### **1. Introduction**\n\nNb3Sn is an A15-type superconductor, which has been actively studied and used in superconducting wire applications [1]. A number of studies have employed Nb3Sn coatings on Nb for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity applications and these studies were motivated by the high critical temperature (Tc) and quality factor (Q0) of this superconductor at a given temperature, compared to Nb [2-4]; Q<sup>0</sup> is defined by the surface resistance (Rs) and the geometric factor (G) of a cavity as G/R<sup>s</sup> . Nb3Sn has lower surface resistance and a higher T<sup>c</sup> than the Nb [5, 6]. Hence, a Nb3Sn SRF cavity is a promising candidate to replace the current Nb SRF cavities for accelerator applications. Recently, studies at Cornell [7, 8] reported a high Q-factor of approximately 10<sup>10</sup> at 4.2 K, with a maximum accelerating electric field gradient up to 17 MV/m for ~2 μm thick Nb3Sn coatings on Nb, prepared by a vapor diffusion process. Active research in vapor diffusion Nb3Sn films is now on-going at Fermilab, Cornell University and Jefferson Laboratory [9].\n\nNb3Sn-coated cavities have been seen to quench superconductivity in the 14-17 MV/m range and some cavities still display a Q-slope, the increase of surface resistance as a function of accelerating field, Fig.1. The surface magnetic field at which the quench occurs, ~70 mT, is, however, significantly lower than the superheating field of Nb3Sn at ~400 mT, the ultimate limit predicted by the theory for an RF superconductor with an ideal surface [10-12]. These limits have been suggested to be a consequence of imperfections in the Nb3Sn coatings [13], including surface roughness, thin regions, Sn-deficient regions, grain boundaries, and surface chemistry.\n\nRecent microstructural analyses have focused on two imperfections of Nb3Sn coatings on Nb, which are anticipated to have significant detrimental effects on the performance of Nb3Sn coated cavities: patchy regions with extremely thin grains [14-16] and Sn-deficient regions [14, 17]. In a joint study between Fermilab and Cornell, coupons were cut out from a cavity, which exhibited a substantially degraded Q0, see Q vs E curve for cavity ERL1-5 displayed in Figure 1, which was linked to localized areas with high surface resistance values. Electron microscopy was performed on coupons cut from the wall of the cavity, which revealed that areas with a high surface-resistance contained grains with an abnormally large transverse length and a thickness of only ~100 nm (compared to a normal value of ~2 μm) [9, 14, 18]. The penetration depth of magnetic fields in Nb3Sn is ~111 nm [12] and Nb3Sn coatings require a thickness of at least ~500 nm to shield the magnetic field effectively and avoid excessive dissipation from poorly superconducting Nb/Sn compounds in the Nb3Sn/Nb interface [14]. The formation of thin grains (< ~500 nm) in the Nb3Sn coating has been reported to be affected by a number of factors including the supply of Sn [19], pre-anodization of the Nb substrate [18], and crystallographic orientation of Nb [15]. There is some evidence that the texture and nucleation of Nb3Sn grains could play a role but the detailed mechanism and origin of the formation of thin grains are still not understood [15]. Also, Sn-deficient regions are one of the primary concerns for Nb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency cavities [17]. The proportion of Sn in Nb3+xSn1-x ranges from ~17 to 26 at.%, Fig. 1 [1, 20], and the T<sup>c</sup> of Nb3Sn varies from 6 K at ~17 at.% Sn to 18.3 K at ~26 at.%. Therefore, Sn-deficient regions with 17-19 at.% Sn can decrease the T<sup>c</sup> of Nb3Sn coatings to below that of Nb, 9 K. The formation of Sn-deficient regions is particularly undesirable near the top surface of Nb3Sn cavities where radiofrequency currents flow. The growth mechanism and compositional variation of Nb3Sn have been rigorously investigated in Nb3Sn samples prepared for superconducting wire applications by a solid-diffusion process using Cu-Sn and Nb diffusion couples, the bronze process [1, 21-25]. The compositional variation in Nb3Sn prepared by soliddiffusion was investigated utilizing a composition gradient between a Sn-rich phase (Nb6Sn5) and bulk Nb, originating from the diffusion process [21, 25-27]. Low levels of Sn in Nb3Sn have been attributed to the small formation energy of Nb antisite point-defects, Nb sitting on Sn sites [26]. There is, however, little information about how Sn-deficient regions are formed during vapor diffusion preparation of a Nb3Sn coating on Nb or about the critical role(s) played by the Nb3Sn/Nb interface in Nb3Sn grain-growth and the formation of thin grains. The objective of the current studies is to investigate the origin of the formation of thin grains and Sn-deficient regions in Nb3Sn coatings on Nb prepared by the vapordiffusion process and the role of Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces on the formation of imperfections in general.\n\nHerein, we report on atomic-scale analyses of Nb3Sn coatings on Nb using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and first-principle calculations. In particular, we find that orientation relationships (ORs) at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface are correlated with the formation of thin-grains and Sn-deficient regions. Through the use of electron diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we identify four types of orientation relationships (ORs) for Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interfaces. Notably, large thin Nb3Sn grains are highly correlated with a certain grain orientation-relationship, specifically Nb3Sn (12̅0)//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (01̅1). Also, first-principles calculations of Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces demonstrate that the formation of Sn-deficient Nb3Sn close to Nb substrates is attributed to the smaller interfacial free energy of Sn-deficient Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces compared to stoichiometric Nb3Sn/Nb. Our findings provide evidence for understanding the formation of imperfections in Nb3Sn coatings on Nb, which may be used to improve the performance of Nb3Sn SRF cavities.\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. (a) Nb-Sn binary phase diagram [1, 20]. (b) Quality factor (Qo) vs electric field (E) curves for different ~2 μm thick Nb3Sn coated superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities [14]. Nb3Sn coated SRF cavity of ERL 1-4 displays a high Qo-factor up to 15-17 MV/m, which is close to the state-of-art performance for a Nb3Sn SRF cavity. ERL 1-5 exhibits a low Qo-factor, that is, a high surface resistance. Thin-grain regions were widely observed in the Nb3Sn SRF cavity of ERL 1-5, with a strong correlation\n\nobserved between the surface resistance of Nb3Sn and microstructures.

Methodologies**\n\n#### **2.1 Experimental procedures**\n\nNb3Sn coatings were prepared at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and Cornell University by a vapor diffusion process, Fig. 1(c); for development of the process see Refs. [2, 3, 9, 10, 28, 29]. Niobium samples, tin source, and a SnCl<sup>2</sup> nucleating agent are placed in a vacuum furnace and heated to 500 ˚C to create nucleation sites of Nb3Sn on the Nb surface. The furnace temperature was then raised to 1100 ˚C for 3.5 h to permit a Nb3Sn coating to form on the Nb surface. The tin source was maintained at 1200 <sup>o</sup>C, so that sufficient Sn could continue to be provided to the top surface of Nb3Sn, which subsequently diffuses into the Nb sample.\n\nIn our studies of nucleation of Nb3Sn, only a SnCl<sup>2</sup> nucleating agent was placed in the furnace, without Sn, and then heated to 500 ˚C to induce nucleation. Next, the temperature was increased to 1100 ˚C and then cooled immediately after reaching 1100 ˚C.\n\nThe samples were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). A 600i Nanolab Helios Focused Ion-Beam (FIB) microscope was employed to prepare cross-sectional samples for TEM. The samples were thinned employing a 30 kV Ga+ ion-beam at 27 pA, and fine-polished using 5 kV Ga+ ions at 47 pA. A Hitachi HD-8100 was used for the bright-field (BF) TEM imaging and electron diffraction analyses, and a Hitachi HD-2300 was used for STEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). High-resolution TEM images were recorded using a JEOL Grand ARM-300 and high-resolution STEM images were acquired using a JEOL aberration-corrected Grand ARM-200. The Gatan Micrograph Suite version 2.11 was used to analyze and process the images. EBSD data was collected using a FEI Quanta field-emission\n\ngun (FEG) SEM equipped with an HKL Nordlys S camera utilizing Oxford AZtec EBSD software. The surfaces of samples were placed at a 10 mm working distance and a 30 kV electron beam with an incident angle of 20<sup>o</sup> was used for accumulating EBSD patterns. For transmission (t-) EBSD, an EM-Tec TE3 t-EBSD holder was utilized to place the surface of a TEM sample at an incident beam angle of 20<sup>o</sup> .\n\n#### **2.2 Computational details**\n\nThe first-principles calculations in this research employed the plane-wave pseudopotential total energy method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [30]. We used projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials [31] and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), developed by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [32] for exchange-correlation. Unless otherwise specified, all structures are fully relaxed with respect to volume, as well as all cell-internal atomic coordinates. We considered carefully the convergence of results with respect to energy cutoff and k-points. A plane-wave basis set was used with an energy cutoff of 600 eV to represent the Kohn-Sham wave functions. A summation over the Brillouin zone for the bulk structures was performed on a 12×12×12 Monkhorst-pack k-point mesh for all calculations and a magnetic spin-polarized method was applied for all calculations. The calculated lattice parameters of Nb and Nb3Sn are 3.324 and 5.332 Å, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, 3.300 Å for Nb [33] and 5.289 Å for Nb3Sn [34]. Both 2×2×2 and 3×3×3 supercells were used to determine the vacancy formation energies, antisite energies, and lattice substitutional energy calculations.\n\n#### **3. Experimental results**\n\n## *3.1 Transmission electron microscopy analysis of nucleated Nb3Sn grains*\n\nAs a first step, we characterized nucleated Nb3Sn grains in the early stages of the Nb3Sn coating process to observe the details of the initial grain growth. The SEM micrograph in Fig. 2 shows nucleated Nb3Sn grains on a Nb surface, with some displaying lateral growth with a flat morphology. Figure 2 displays three connected nucleated Nb3Sn grains with diameters of ~500 nm (n1), ~200 nm (n2), and ~100 nm (n3), respectively. Two of these nucleated Nb3Sn grains were selected and cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared from them using a dual-beam FIB microscope. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images in Fig. 2 reveal that the thickness of the nucleated grain n1, was ~100 nm and that of n2 was ~60 nm. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of Nb Lα (2.17 keV) and Sn Lα (3.44 keV) lines performed in the STEM mode indicates that the concentration of Sn in the nucleated Nb3Sn grain is 16-19 at.%, which is Sn-deficient compared to the nominal concentration of 25 at.% Sn in Nb3Sn.\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. (a) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of nucleated Nb3Sn grains prepared at Fermilab. Three nucleated grains are labeled n1, n2, and n3. The region for cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is indicated by a parallelogram. (b) high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) image and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps of Nb Lα (2.17 keV) and Sn Lα (3.44 keV) of the nucleated Nb3Sn grains.\n## *3.2 Transmission electron microscopy analyses of Nb3Sn grains*\n\nThe microstructures of the Nb3Sn coating and the Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces were analyzed employing brightfield transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron-microscopy (HAADF-STEM), EDS, and high-resolution-scanning/transmission electronmicroscopy (HR-S/TEM) after the coating process was completed. The results displayed significant variations in the microstructures with respect to the net Sn-flux, which was estimated by taking the average thickness of the Nb3Sn coating and the coating process time. It is possible to distinguish three different regions (Table 1): (1) abnormally large-grain regions for a high Sn-flux; (2) normal grain-size regions for a medium Sn-flux; and (3) patchy regions with thin grains for a low Sn-flux.\n\nTable 1. Summary of the three regions of the Nb3Sn coatings with different microstructures, which depend on the net Sn flux or growth rate.\n\n|                                 | Net Sn flux     | Average growth rate | Average thickness |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                                 | [atoms/nm2 min] | [nm/min]            | [μm]              |\n| Abnormally large-grain regions  | 322             | 24                  | ~5                |\n| Normal-grain regions            | 161             | 12                  | ~2.5              |\n| Patchy regions with thin-grains | 47              | 3.5                 | ~0.7              |\n\n## *3.2.1 Abnormally large Nb3Sn grain regions (average growth rate: 24 nm/min)*\n\nIn the case of a high net Sn-flux (high average growth rate of 24 nm/min), we observed regions with abnormally large and irregularly shaped Nb3Sn grains, SEM image of Fig 3(a), recorded using a secondary-electron (SE) detector. The regions have a rounded-shape and a size that varies from tens to hundreds of microns. Abnormally large grain size regions have bright contrast, compared to neighboring regions with normal-size grains, possibly due to topological effects from the rough Nb3Sn surface. HAADF-STEM imaging of a cross-section of Nb3Sn/Nb, Fig 3(c), yields both the grain size and thickness, ~ 5 μm for each. STEM-EDS analyses of the abnormally large grains reveal a concentration of ~26 at.% Sn, which is similar to normal Nb3Sn grains, suggesting that the stoichiometry of the abnormally large grain regions is also Nb3Sn. The round shape of the abnormally large grain regions and the irregular outline of large Nb3Sn grains in the region imply the abrupt formation of Nb3Sn phases from a liquid droplet of Sn, which is discussed further in section 4.1.\n\n![](0__page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3. (a) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of abnormally large grain regions of the Nb3Sn coating prepared at Fermilab, recorded using a secondary-electron (SE) detector. (b) SEM image of the boundary between abnormally large-grain regions and normal grain-regions tilted by 52˚ from the SEM's optic axis. (c) HAADF-STEM image of a cross-section of Nb3Sn/Nb across regions with normal grains and abnormally large grains. The composition of one of the abnormally large grains is estimated using STEM-EDS analyses exhibiting similar values (26 at.% Sn compared to 25 at.% Sn in the normal grains).\n\n## *3.2.2 Normal Nb3Sn grain regions (average growth rate: 12 nm/min)*\n\nThe HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 4(c) demonstrates that the Nb3Sn coatings on Nb are approximately 2.5 ± 1.0 m thick, with its surface features revealed in the SE (secondary electron)-SEM image, Fig. 4(a). The sample in the SEM image was tilted by 52˚ from the SEM's optic-axis to display the granular roughness of the surface. Utilizing SEM imaging, the average grain size for two samples, A5 and A10, is 2.0 ± 0.6 m. Quantitative analyses of the Nb3Sn coatings employing STEM-EDS reveals the presence of Sn-deficient regions. Most of these regions are close to the Nb substrate, although they are occasionally observed in the middle of Nb3Sn grains, Fig. 4(d). Quantification of the composition of two Sn-deficient regions (numbers 1 and 3) is ≈19 at.% Sn compared to the anticipated value of 25 at.% Sn for stoichiometric Nb3Sn.\n\nNext, we analyzed the Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces utilizing BF-TEM, HR-TEM and electron diffraction. The results yield orientation relationships (ORs) between Nb3Sn and Nb at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface. Fig 5(a) displays a HR-TEM image of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface in normal Nb3Sn grain regions. The HR-TEM image was recorded for a Nb [1̅11] zone-axis, which reveals the orientation relationships of the Nb3Sn grains with the Nb substrate. One grain (labeled Orientation A) has an orientation relationship with Nb of Nb3Sn (12̅0)//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (11̅2), while another grain (labeled Orientation C) is Nb3Sn (12̅0)//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (01̅1). Owing to the orientation relationship of two grains at a Nb3Sn/Nb interface a [12̅0] tilt grain-boundary with 29<sup>o</sup> tilt-angle is formed. The HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 5(b) exhibits another OR at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface for a Nb [011] zone axis. As seen in Fig. 5(c), the electron diffraction pattern of one of the grains at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface (indicated by the red dotted circle in Fig. 5(b)) has the following ORs: Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (011) and Nb3Sn (130)//Nb (002) (termed Orientation D).\n\n![](0__page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4. (a) Secondary-electron (SE) SEM image of a Nb3Sn surface, which displays roughness due to the granularity of Nb3Sn (the surface was tilted 52° from the SEM's optic axis). The samples were coated at Fermilab. (b) Histogram of grain sizes (diameters) of A5 and A10 samples with an average grain size\n\nof 2.0 ± 0.6 m. (c) A cross-sectional view of a Nb3Sn film on Nb, obtained using HAADF-STEM. (d) An HAADF-STEM image and overlays of the STEM image and EDS Sn L map on it. Sn-deficient regions are observed near bulk Nb (denoted by 1 and 3). The tin concentration of region numbers 1 and 3 is 19 at.%, while that of region number 2 is 25 at.%.\n\n![](0__page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5. (a) HR-TEM image of Nb3Sn/Nb for normal-grain regions, showing two grains grown epitaxially on Nb with their orientation relationships. The Nb3Sn coating was prepared at Cornell University. The orientation relationships correspond to a 29<sup>o</sup> /[12̅0] tilt grain-boundary. (b) HAADF-STEM image of a Nb3Sn/Nb interface with a Nb [011] zone-axis. The region for the electron diffraction pattern is indicated by a red-dotted circle. The sample was prepared at Fermilab. (c) The electron diffraction pattern of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface yields the following orientation relationships, Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (011) and Nb3Sn (130)//Nb (002), termed Orientation D.\n\n## *3.2.3 Patchy regions with thin Nb3Sn grains (average growth rate: 5 nm/min)*\n\nAs previously reported [9, 14, 35], patchy regions including thin-grains with a large lateral grain size of up to many tens of microns form in regions with a low net Sn-flux of ~47 Sn atoms/nm<sup>2</sup> min (slow average growth rate of ~5 nm/min). The HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 6 presents one of the patchy regions with thin Nb3Sn grains (grains numbers 1 and 5). The ORs of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface, of the seven grains in the TEM sample, were analyzed by electron diffraction or HR-TEM, which are displayed in Fig. 6. The first grain to be analyzed is the relatively thick grain (grain number 3). Compositional variations within the regions of grains numbers 3 and 4 are examined by STEM-EDS, Fig. 7(c), which reveals that there are low levels of Sn in portions of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface [17]. Atomically resolved HR-STEM images of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface for grain number 3 were recorded using a JEOL aberration corrected Grand ARM-200, Fig. 7(a). This interface displays epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on Nb with Orientation A, Nb3Sn (12̅0) //Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002) //Nb (11̅2) agreeing with the electron diffraction pattern of this interface in Fig. 7(b). The interplanar distance of Nb3Sn (002) is 2.63 Å (JCPDS No. 04-017-6755), while the value for Nb (11̅2) is 2.70 Å (JCPDS No. 00-035-0789), which results in an ~2.8% lattice mismatch and produces a tensile strain in the Nb3Sn grain along the [002] direction. There are additional misfit dislocations at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface due to the lattice mismatch between Nb3Sn and Nb. Another OR, Orientation B, is observed in grains numbers 2 and 4. As observed in the electron diffraction pattern of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface of grain numbers 2 and 3, Fig. 8 (a), the (002) plane of Nb3Sn grain number 2 is parallel to Nb (231̅), which implies that grain number 2 is tilted by 8.9<sup>o</sup> about the Nb3Sn [12̅0] axis from grain number 3 with Orientation A. The HR-TEM image of grain numbers 2 and 3, Fig. 8 (b), demonstrates that the Nb3Sn grains form an 8.9<sup>o</sup> /[12̅0] tilt grain boundary.\n\n![](0__page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6. HAADF-STEM image of the patchy region with thin Nb3Sn grains. Three types of orientation relationships (Orientations A, B, and C) are observed. Transmission electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) mapping of four grains, grains numbers 2 to 5, was conducted to identify the misorientation axes and angles for Orientations A, B, and C. The Nb3Sn film was coated at Fermilab.\n\n![](0__page_16_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7. (a) Atomically-resolved HR-STEM image of the Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces of grain number 3 and corresponding atomic configurations displaying epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on Nb with Orientation A, right-hand side. The solid-red circles are Sn atoms and the solid-blue circles are Nb atoms. (b) Corresponding electron diffraction pattern of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface of grain number 3. (c) STEM-EDS\n\nSn Lα (3.44 keV) mapping of the region of grain numbers 3, 4 and 5. The area of the HR-STEM image is denoted by a yellow dotted square.\n\n![](0__page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 8. (a) Electron diffraction pattern of the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interface of grain numbers 2 and 3. The (002) plane of Nb3Sn grain number 2 is parallel to the (231̅) plane of Nb, denoted Orientation B. (b) HR-TEM image of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface of grain numbers 2 and 3, showing the formation of an 8.9<sup>o</sup> /[12̅0] tilt GB.\n\nGrain number 5 was analyzed as a representative of the thin grains. HR-STEM imaging of the Nb3Sn/Nb interface with the thin-grain number 5 is displayed in Fig. 9(a) and it possess Orientation C, Nb3Sn (12̅0)//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (01̅1). For Orientation C, the Nb3Sn/Nb interface has a large lattice mismatch (12.3%) between the Nb3Sn (002) plane with d = 2.63 Å and the Nb (01̅1) plane with d = 2.34 Å. Indeed, a high density of misfit dislocations, representing extra Nb (01̅1) planes, is observed in the HR-STEM image, Fig. 9. The misfit dislocations appear at approximately every eight Nb (01̅1) planes at the interface, which is in agreement with the lattice mismatch of 12.3%. A STEM-EDS map of the thin-grain in Fig. 9(b) reveals that an ~100 nm thick Sn-deficient layer exists at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface, probably due to the high compressive strain on the Nb3Sn (12̅0) plane. The increase of the lattice parameter of Nb3Sn by adding Sn (<sup>1</sup> ) is ≈ 2.610-2 per at.% of Sn [36], which leads to a volume\nsize factor (Ωsf) of Sn in Nb3Sn of 8 % [37]. An HR-TEM study of another thin-grain (grain number 1) displays the same OR as the thin Nb3Sn grain (grain number 5): see Fig. S.1 in Supplementary information. Orientations A, B, C, and D and their lattice mismatches are summarized in Table S.1. The lattice mismatches are estimated assuming stoichiometric 25 at.% Sn Nb3Sn since the difference of the lattice parameter of Nb3Sn between 17 to 25 at.% Sn is small, ~0.2% [36],\n\n![](1__page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 9. (a) Atomically-resolved HR-STEM image of the Nb3Sn/Nb-heterophase interface of grain number 5 with Orientation C, and corresponding atomic configurations showing epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on Nb, right-hand side. The solid-red circles are Sn atoms and the solid-blue circles are Nb atoms. (b) HAADF-STEM EDS Sn L map of grain number 5. The region of the HR-STEM image at the Nb3Sn (grain number 5)/Nb-heterophase interface is indicated by a yellow dotted square.\n\nTransmission (t-) EBSD was performed to identify the misorientation axes and angles of Orientations A, B and C, Fig. 6. For Orientation A and B, both have an ~40<sup>o</sup> rotation angle about the <334> rotation axis between Nb3Sn and Nb. They are not clearly distinguishable due to the small misorientation angle between Orientations A and B, 8.9<sup>o</sup> about the <120> axis, and deviations of the Euler angle measurements (~3<sup>o</sup> ) determined from the EBSD patterns. Orientation C displays <123> or <124> rotation axes with ~50<sup>o</sup> of rotation, Table S.2. The misorientation axes and rotation angles of Orientations A, B and C were used to analyze the ORs of normal grain regions and patchy regions with thin-grains comparatively, using normal or transmission EBSD, section 4.2.\n\n## *3.3 Vacancy formation and antisite substitutional behavior in Nb3Sn*\n\nWe used first-principles calculations to understand the formation of Nb and Sn antisite defects and vacancies. The vacancy formation energies, *E<sup>V</sup>* , for both Nb and Nb3Sn are described using a 2×2×2 supercell employing the following equation [38]:\n\n$$E\\_{\\rm V} = E\\_{\\rm V}^{\\rm TOT} - E\\_{\\rm bulk}^{\\rm Total} + \\mu \\tag{1}$$\n\nWhere *TOT E<sup>V</sup>* is the total energy of the supercell with a vacancy, *Total Ebulk* is the total energy of the supercell without a vacancy, and is the chemical potential of the atom removed from the vacancy site. Our calculations yield the following results: (i) *EV* is 2.82 eV/atom for Nb in bulk Nb; (ii) 3.95 eV/atom for Sn in Nb3Sn; and (iii) 2.04 eV/atom for Nb in Nb3Sn. A Nb vacancy in Nb3Sn has a smaller formation energy and thus is more readily formed than a Sn vacancy in Nb3Sn. Both Nb and Sn vacancies play a major role for understanding bulk diffusion in Nb3Sn.\n\nThe antisite substitutional structures were modeled by allowing either Nb or Sn to substitute at either the Sn or Nb sublattice sites in both the 2×2×2 and 3×3×3 Nb3Sn superlattices and then fully relaxing the structures. The antisite energies in Nb3Sn were calculated employing the following equations [38, 39]:\n\n$$E\\_{\\rm Nb\\toSn} = (E\\_{\\rm Nb\\_3(Sn\\_{b\\\\_s}Mb\\_s)}^{\\rm rot} + \\mu\\_{\\rm Sn}) - (E\\_{\\rm Nb\\_3\\to}^{\\rm rot} + \\mu\\_{\\rm Nb}) \\tag{2}$$\n\n$$E\\_{\\rm Sn-Abb} = (E\\_{(\\rm M\\_{\\rm 1}, \\rm 5n\\_{\\gamma})\\_3 \\rm Sn}^{\\rm rot} + \\mu\\_{\\rm Nb}) - (E\\_{\\rm Nb\\_3 \\rm Sn}^{\\rm rot} + \\mu\\_{\\rm Sn}) \\tag{3}$$\n\nwhere μ<sup>i</sup> is the chemical potential of Nb or Sn, 3 *TOT ENb Sn* is the total energy of Nb3Sn, 3 1 ( ) *x x TOT ENb Sn Nb* is the total energy of Nb3Sn with Nb at a Sn sublattice site, and 1 3 ( ) *y y TOT E Nb Sn Sn* is the total energy of Nb3Sn with Sn in a Nb sublattice site. The first-principles results in Table 2 demonstrate that a Nb antisite atom forms more readily than a Sn antisite atom in both the 2×2×2 and 3×3×3 Nb3Sn superlattices, because *ENb Sn* is significantly smaller than *ESn Nb* . The Nb antisite atom generates both smaller average atomic forces and local atomic displacements. The experimental results in this study demonstrate the presence of Sn deficient regions close to the Nb substrate and the first-principle calculations indicate that Sn-deficient Nb3Sn is an Nb-antisite compound, with Sn sites being replaced by Nb atoms, with Nb vacancies as secondary point defects with small concentrations of Sn vacancies due to their high vacancy formation energy.\n\nTable 2.

Discussion**\n\n## *4.1 Effect of Sn-flux (growth rate) on the microstructure of Nb3Sn on Nb*\n\nThis study describes the microstructure of three regions of the Nb3Sn coatings on Nb, which are formed by different rates of a net Sn flux (or average growth rate). As Table 1 demonstrates, the microstructure of a Nb3Sn coating is affected strongly by the net Sn-flux during its formation. This is important because a homogeneous high-quality Nb3Sn coating on Nb with a reasonably smooth surface, no uncoated regions or thin grains, and smaller composition variations is critical for the performance of Nb3Sn SRF cavities to avoid heating at microstructural imperfections. A uniform Nb3Sn coating with an average grain size of 2 ± 0.6 μm and a thickness of ~2.5 μm was obtained with a medium Sn flux whose value is about 161 Sn atoms/nm<sup>2</sup> min, Fig. 4 and Table 1. Our results indicate that the Sn-flux has a strong influence on the kinetics of Nb3Sn's nucleation and growth during the coating process. A large net Sn-flux (322 Sn atoms/nm<sup>2</sup> min), and a growth rate of 24 nm/min are associated with the formation of abnormally large grains (more than 5 μm) and a rough surface topology of a Nb3Sn coating, Fig. 3. This is probably due to the abrupt formation of Nb3Sn grains with the concomitant formation of liquid Sn-droplets on the surface. The melting temperature of Sn is low, 231.9 <sup>o</sup>C, so that Sn is in the liquid state at the process temperature, 1100 <sup>o</sup>C. Therefore, if the flux of Sn atoms from the vapor phase is greater than the diffusion of Sn into bulk Nb3Sn, Sn may accumulate on the surface and form liquid droplets on top of Nb3Sn. This supposition is supported by the round morphology of the abnormally large grain regions representing Sn droplets formed in a range of diameters, from tens to hundreds of microns, when using a high Sn-flux, Fig. 3(a). In contrast, patchy regions with ~200 nm thick thin grains with a large lateral diameter more than ~4 micron, appear on the surface in the region with low net Sn-flux (47 Sn atoms/nm<sup>2</sup> min). This indicates that the nucleation of Nb3Sn is non-uniform and some of the thin grains outgrow others in a lateral direction. Details of the origin of the thin Nb3Sn grains are discussed in section 4.3.\n\n## *4.2 Orientation relationships at Nb3Sn/Nb*\n\nIn addition to the effect of the Sn-flux on the microstructure of Nb3Sn, the primary finding is that Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interfaces play a critical role in the formation of imperfections in Nb3Sn coatings, such as thin-grains and Sn-deficient regions. Specifically, a strong correlation exists between the formation of thin-grains and Orientation C, Fig. 9. Four types of ORs for the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interfaces (Orientations A, B, C and D) were found and three of these ORs (Orientation A, B, C) were frequently observed on the zone axis of Nb [1̅11] with Nb3Sn [12̅0], Fig. 6, which suggests that these interfaces have lower interfacial free energies than alternative interfaces.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the orientation relationships, in particular, Orientations A, B and C, were observed more frequently in patchy regions for the case of a low Sn-flux compared to medium and high Sn-fluxes. EBSD and transmission EBSD analyses were employed to analyze ORs of Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interfaces in normal grain-regions and patchy regions with thin grains, Fig. 10 and Table 3. A total 66 interfaces of normal grain regions and 13 interfaces of patchy regions with thin grains were analyzed and the latter display a higher frequency of Orientations A, B and C, ~ 69%, compared to the interfaces in normal grain regions, ~17%, Table 3. This is probably because the small Sn-flux results in\n\nslow growth of Nb3Sn grains, providing sufficient time for the Sn atoms to diffuse into the Nb substrate and form a stable Nb3Sn/Nb interface.\n\nTable 3. Statistics of orientation relationships at Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces in normal Nb3Sn regions and patchy regions with thin Nb3Sn grains. Sixty-six grains were analyzed in the normal regions and thirteen grains were analyzed in the patchy regions with thin thin-grains using EBSD, transmission EBSD, and TEM analyses.\n\n|                  | Frequencies          |                                          |  |  |\n|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--|--|\n| Orientation type | Normal Nb3Sn regions | Patchy<br>regions with thin Nb3Sn grains |  |  |\n|                  | (N = 66)             | (N=13)                                   |  |  |\n| Orientation A    | 5% a                 | 15<br>%                                  |  |  |\n| Orientation B    |                      | 15<br>%                                  |  |  |\n| Orientation C    | 12 %                 | 39<br>%                                  |  |  |\n| Others           | 83 %                 | 31<br>%                                  |  |  |\n\n<sup>a</sup> Orientation A and B are not distinguishable in transmission (t-) EBSD due to the deviations of the Euler angles in the EBSD data (see Table S.2 in Supplementary information).\n\n![](1__page_24_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 10. Transmission EBSD map of: (a) normal grain regions and (b) patchy regions with thin-grains. Two grains among fifteen grains in the TEM sample with normal regions (a) have Orientation C, denoted by white arrows. Also, the thin-grain (b) has Orientation C. Transmission electron-microscope sample (a) was prepared at Fermilab and sample (b) was prepared at Cornell University.\n\n# *4.3 Origin of the formation of thin grains*\n\nGrains with Orientation C [Nb3Sn (12̅0) //Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002) //Nb (01̅1) ] are consistently significantly thinner than the other grains, indicating that the interfacial migration rate of these grains is slower than that of the other grains. The slow interfacial migration rate can be rationalized by the high dislocation density of misfit dislocations due to a large lattice mismatch, 12.3%. The HR-STEM image, Fig. 9, demonstrates that the misfit dislocations are separated by ~2 nm. The migration of these interfaces requires climbing and/or gliding of the misfit dislocations and the energy required for these processes could retard the velocity of the reaction front [40, 41].\n\nThe influence of ORs on the interfacial migration rate, during a solid-state reaction, has been reported for other systems, especially growth of a spinel on MgO or sapphire (Al2O3) [40-48]. For MgAl2O<sup>4</sup> spinelgrowth between MgO and Al2O3, the MgAl2O4/MgO interface is pinned by a high misfit dislocationdensity; one dislocation every ~23 atomic plane of (010) MgAl2O4, caused by the large lattice mismatch\n\n(2 MgAl2O4– 2MgO MgAl2O4+ 2MgO ≈ -4.3%) [47]. Similarly, for ZnAl2O<sup>4</sup> growth between ZnO and Al2O3, the reaction at the ZnAl2O4/ZnO interface, which has a large lattice mismatch (-13.7%), is limited due to dislocation gliding and/or climbing, while the ZnAl2O4/Al2O<sup>3</sup> interface with a smaller lattice mismatch (2.1%) is relatively mobile [45]. Interfacial migration of an interface with a large lattice mismatch requires climb of the misfit dislocations at the interface, which is the rate-limiting step [45, 47]. In the case of Nb3Sn, the nucleated grain with Orientation C may preferentially spread in the lateral direction rather than increasing its thickness. This would give rise to the formation of abnormally large thin-grains during the early stage of Nb3Sn growth. The formation of large thin-grains significantly reduces the Sn supply to the Nb3Sn/Nb interface due to the decreased density of grain boundaries (which act as short circuit diffusion pathways). As a result, the interfacial reaction rate at Nb3Sn/Nb becomes even slower.\n\nAnother factor that influences the formation of thin Nb3Sn grains is the growth rate [49]. Thin grains with a large lateral diameter appeared when the average growth rate was slow (~3.5 nm/min) as a consequence of a small net Sn flux (~47 Sn atoms/nm<sup>2</sup> min), and they are not observed in medium and high net Sn-flux regions. The experimental evidence in this article is not sufficient to demonstrate that the average tin flux during the coating process is represented by the net tin-flux measured after coating, but it is logical that a high average tin-flux could help prevent the growth of large thin grains. When the Sn flux is high, the density of nucleation sites increases and, therefore, the lateral growth of the thin grains is limited due to the competition with neighboring Nb3Sn grains.\n\n#### *4.4 Formation of Sn-deficient regions: nucleation and their evolution*\n\nIn the Nb-Sn binary phase diagram, Fig.1, the composition of Nb3Sn in the two-phase equilibrium phasefield (Nb plus Nb3Sn) is ~17 at.% Sn at 1100 <sup>o</sup>C, and it is therefore reasonable that the nucleated Nb3Sn grains at the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interface have this Sn concentration, Fig. 2. As discussed, the Sn-deficient regions are probably initially formed at the Nb3Sn/Nb-heterophase-interface and the Sn deficiency in the middle of a grain is a consequence of slow Sn diffusion, ~100 nm/h [50], in Nb3Sn. First-principle calculations revealed that the Nb anti-site defect has a small formation energy, ~0.3 eV/atom (Table 2) and the formation of Sn-deficient regions may be assisted by the small formation energy of Nb anti-site defects [26, 34, 50]. The concentration of Sn-deficient regions is 17 to 19 at.% Sn, and this implies that 0.24 to 0.32 fraction of Sn sites are occupied by Nb atoms in these regions.\n\nThe interfacial energy of the Nb/Nb3Sn heterophase-interface is essential for understanding the mechanisms and stability of this heterophase-interface with vicinal orientations. Specifically, the interfacial energy plays a critical role in the nucleation of Nb3Sn because the strain energy and the formation energy of Nb antisite defects are negligible compared to the interfacial energy in the nucleation stage [51-53]. We calculate the energies of the four simple interfaces with Orientations A and B, which our experiments detected: (i) Nb3Sn ( 12̅0 )//Nb( 1̅11 ); (ii) Nb3Sn(002)//Nb( 11̅2 ); (iii) Nb3Sn(210)//Nb(110) with Orientation A; and (iv) Nb3Sn(002)//Nb(231̅) with Orientation B. Orientation C is excluded because it exhibits abnormal Nb3Sn growth and difficult to simulate using first-principles calculations due to the large lattice mismatch. The interfacial configurations were constructed with the initial positions based on ideal Nb and Nb3Sn phases; the latter was stretched to match the Nb phase. We subsequently fully relaxed all the atomic positions, with the unit vector normal to the (hkl) plane of the interface. The interfacial internal energies at 0 K are calculated by subtracting the total energy of the phases on either side of the interface from the total energy of a two-phase system containing an interface:\n\n$$\n\\sigma\\_{\\text{Nb} \\land \\text{Nb}\\_3 \\& n} = \\frac{1}{2A} \\left[ E\\_{\\text{Nb} \\lor \\text{Nb}\\_3 \\& n}^{\\text{tot}} - (E\\_{\\text{Nb}}^{\\text{tot}} + E\\_{\\text{Nb}\\_3 \\& n}^{\\text{tot}}) \\right] \\tag{4}\n$$\nwhere *A* is the interfacial area, *tot ENb* is the total internal energy of the Nb phase, 3 *tot ENb Sn* is the total internal energy of the stretched Nb3Sn phase, 3 / *tot ENb Nb Sn* is the total internal energy of the relaxed Nb/Nb3Sn system containing an interface; this was done for four different orientations. The calculated values of the interfacial internal energies at 0 K are summarized in Table 4. Nb3Sn(002)//Nb(11̅2) with Orientation A has the lowest interfacial internal energy and Nb3Sn(210)//Nb(110) with Orientation A has the largest interfacial internal energy. We note that the interfaces with Sn-deficient Nb3Sn for all four orientations have 11 to 12% smaller interfacial internal energies than those with the exact Nb3Sn stoichiometry, Table 4. In the early nucleation stage, the change of the bulk internal energy is negligible and Nb3Sn nucleates readily in regions with a small interfacial internal energy. This reflects the fact that the nucleated Nb3Sn, Fig. 2, is Sn-deficient and there is a large amount of nucleated Sn-deficient Nb3Sn existing at Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase-interfaces in a Nb3Sn layer in our experiments, Figs. 4, 7 and 9.\n\nOnce the Sn-deficient Nb3Sn phase is nucleated and grows at Nb3Sn/Nb-heterophase-interfaces, Sndeficient Nb3Sn transforms to stoichiometric Nb3Sn by replacing Nb antisite atoms with Sn. Diffusion of Sn within a Nb3Sn grain is slow due to the highly correlated diffusion of Sn in this ordered structure [26, 34, 50]. We note that the diffusion coefficient of Sn in Nb3Sn is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than even that of Nb at 1100 <sup>o</sup>C and the root-mean-square diffusion distance of Sn in Nb3Sn is ~100 nm in one hour at 1100 <sup>o</sup>C [50, 54]. As a consequence, a coating time of 3.5 h is insufficient to allow Sn-deficient regions to achieve the equilibrium concentration of 25 at.% Sn, if the size of the Sndeficient regions is more than ~350 nm.\n\nBased on our observations and prior studies [18, 19, 35], we propose a scheme for the growth of normal Nb3Sn grains on Nb that is summarized in Fig. 11. At the nucleation step, Fig.11, Sn vapor condenses on the Nb surface forming Sn nucleation sites for Nb3Sn embryos, which become stable Nb3Sn nuclei that eventually become Nb3Sn grains. According to the phase diagram, first-principles calculations, and STEM-EDS results, the Nb3Sn nuclei are likely to be Sn deficient, see Figs. 1, 2 and Table 4. When the temperature is increased to 1100 <sup>o</sup>C, significant grain growth of Nb3Sn occurs [18] and the lateral growth of Nb3Sn results in impingement and coalescence of Nb3Sn grains, which result in grain boundaries [55]. Once Nb3Sn covers completely the Nb substrate, the growth of the Nb3Sn coating is controlled by an interfacial reaction at the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interface and is limited by the diffusion of Sn along the grain-boundaries, that is, short-circuit diffusion. In this case, there could be Sn-deficient regions in the middle of grains resulting from slow Sn-diffusion in Nb3Sn, which is highly correlated.\n\nTable 4.

The interfacial structure is Nb/Nb3Sn. The Nb slab has 66 atoms and the Nb3Sn slab has 64 atoms. Three Nb antisites are employed in the Sn-deficient Nb3Sn slab resulting in 20.3 at.% Sn.\n\n![](2__page_29_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 11. Schematic diagram for proposed coating process of Nb3Sn on Nb employing vapor diffusion of Sn. The nucleated embryos of Nb3Sn in step 2 (Nucleation of Nb3Sn) grow laterally to form a continuous layer of Nb3Sn, which has regions that are deficient in Sn (step 3 – grain growth of Nb3Sn). In step 4 (formation of a complete layer of Nb3Sn), note the presence of a grain boundary, which is an important short-circuit for diffusion of Sn toward the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interface.\n\n## *4.5 Correlation between microstructure and superconductivity of Nb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities*\n\nRef. [14] describes the study in which a direct correlation was made between the degradation of the Q<sup>0</sup> of an SRF cavity (Q vs E curve of ERL1-5 in Fig. 1) and thin-grains in the regions of degraded performance. We reexamined one of the coupons from a region with degraded performance and analyzed one of the thin-grains for ORs. It also exhibited Orientation C as demonstrated using electron diffraction, Fig. 12 (c,d), which provides additional strong evidence that the degradation of superconductivity in a Nb3Sn cavity is due to thin-grains, which is caused by specific ORs of Nb3Sn/Nb associated with small net Snfluxes. Therefore, a critical net Sn flux is required to avoid the formation of thin-grains with Orientation C. Also, pre-anodization of Nb substrates, which introduces 70~100 nm niobium oxide layers on Nb, is employed to induce homogeneous nucleation of Nb3Sn embryos at a high number density, which significantly reduces the large lateral growth of the thin-grains with Orientation C, Fig. 12(a,b) [18, 35]. Indeed, the grain with Orientation C found in the Nb3Sn coating on pre-anodized Nb is similar in grain size (~ 2 μm) to other neighboring grains, Fig. 12(a,b). Furthermore, the cavity with the grain with Orientation C exhibits no degradation of superconductivity until 17 MV/m, similar to ERL 1-4 in Fig. 1(b). This demonstrates that even though grains with Orientation C may be present in a Nb3Sn coating, the detrimental effects of thin grains on SRF cavity performance can be mitigated by controlling the Snflux and inducing homogeneous nucleation of Nb3Sn embryos using pre-anodization of Nb substrates. It is possible that Nb oxide-layers on the surface may interfere with the epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on Nb, causing more randomly oriented and more chemically uniform Nb3Sn coatings.\n\nThe effect of Sn-deficient Nb3Sn on the superconductivity of Nb3Sn SRF cavity is anticipated to be unfavorable because the T<sup>c</sup> of Sn-deficient Nb3Sn (17 at.% Sn) decreases from 18.3 K of perfect Nb3Sn to 6 K, which is less than the T<sup>c</sup> of Nb (9.2 K). The distribution of Sn-deficient regions in the Nb3Sn coatings and detailed correlations between Sn-deficient regions and SRF cavity performance require additional in-depth studies.\n\n![](2__page_31_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 12.

Notably, there is a close relationship between the formation of thin-grains in low Sn-flux regions and the ORs, Nb3Sn (12̅0//Nb (1̅11) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (01̅1), termed Orientation C. Orientation C displays a large lattice mismatch (12.3%) between Nb3Sn (002)and Nb (01̅1) and a high density of misfit dislocations as observed employing HR-STEM images.\n- The formation of abnormally thin-grains is attributed to the slow migration of the Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interface with Orientation C, caused by its high density of misfit dislocations.\n- The formation of Sn-deficient regions at the heterophase interfaces were also quantified employing first-principle calculations. We found that heterophase interfaces with Sn-deficient Nb3Sn have smaller interfacial internal energies than those with perfect Nb3Sn.\n- In the early nucleation stage, the new phase with a small interfacial free energy nucleates readily when the change of the bulk internal energy is small, which results in large areas of Sn-deficient Nb3Sn existing in the Nb3Sn layer as experimentally demonstrated.\n- The Nb3Sn/Nb heterophase interfaces and the crystallographic orientation relationships of Nb3Sn with Nb play important roles in the formation of abnormal thin-grains and Sn-deficient regions, imperfections that are detrimental to the superconducting properties of Nb3Sn SRF cavities.\n- The current study may yield new possibilities for controlling the imperfections in Nb3Sn coatings and improving their quality to increase the accelerating electric field of Nb3Sn cavities.\n\n## **Acknowledgements**\n\nWe are grateful to Drs.

Based on our microstructural analyses of the thin grains, we conclude that the thin regions are probably a result of a slow interfacial migration with this particular OR. The Sn-deficient regions are seen to form initially at the Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn/Nb interface and remain in the grains due to the slow diffusion of Sn in bulk Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn. The formation of Sn-deficient regions and the effects of interfacial energies on the formation of Sn-deficient regions at different interfaces are estimated by first-principles calculations. The finding of ORs at the Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn/Nb interface provides important information about the formation of imperfections in Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn coatings, such as large thin-regions and Sn-deficient regions, which are critical to the performance of Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn SRF cavities for accelerators.",
