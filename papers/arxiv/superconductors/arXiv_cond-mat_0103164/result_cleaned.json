Far-infrared re ectivity studies on the polycrystallic compound M gB2 with a superconducting transition tem perature To = 39 K were perform ed at tem peratures 20 K to 300 K .

[1]. M ost studies perform ed on this com pound yet indicate that M gB 2 consistently behaves as a phonon m ediated superconductor within the fram ew ork of the BCS theory, probably in a strong coupling limit [2,3, 4,5]. Up to now no optical investigations of this m aterial were reported, and this is in part due to the poor quality of the presently available samples, which are sintered polycrystals. It is well know n, how ever, that optical spectroscopy is an extrem ely pow erfulm ethod for studying the m aterials in the superconducting (SC ) state and is able of providing information on such im portant param eters as the SC energy gap, penetration depth, coherence e ects, scattering m echanism , etc. [6,7].\n\nIn this short note we report on far-infrared re ectivity m easurem ents perform ed on a sintered pellet of M gB2 . We are fully aware that these experim ents bear inherent problem s, m ainly connected with the surface roughness, w hich we cannot overcom e at this point. Nevertheless, we have attem pted to extract in portant inform ation on the intrinsic properties of M gB2 from our re ectivity data.\n\nM gB2 has a hexagonal structure w ith P 6-m m m sym m etry. It crystallizes in the so-called A B2 structure where the boron atom s are located at a prim itive honeycom b lattice, consisting of graphite type sheets. The structure of M gB2 is show n in F ig. 1; the dim ensions ofthe unit cellare a= 3.086 A and = 3.524 A , according to our X -ray analysis. The borons span hexagonal prism s; the large, alm ost spherical pores are led by M g which acts as a spacer. Sim ilar to graphite, the distance between the boron planes is larger by a factor of two compared to the intraplanar B-B bonds, and hence the B-B bonding is strongly anisotropic (two-dim ensional) .\n\nPowder of high purity M gB 2 was pressed in a pellet and treated in Ar atm osphere at 900 C ; details on the sam ple preparation are reported in Ref. [1]. The quality of the sintered sam ples was checked by X -ray analysis, resistivity, and susceptibility measurem ents. In Fig. 1 the tem perature dependence of the dc resistivity and of the m agnetic susceptibility are plotted. The SC phase transition is characterized by a w idth of less than 1 K from resistivity and of around 5 K from the susceptibility m ea-\n\n![](_page_0_Figure_15.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

In addition,norm alincidencespectra werecollected in the sam e frequency range,w hich were qualitatively consistent w ith the grazing re\n ectance data reported in this paper.\n\nIn our m easurem ents,we have observed that the copperblock on w hich the sam ple ism ounted in the cryostat and the sam ple surface had quite di erent tem peratures. In orderto geta precisesurfacetem perature,an additional Pt therm oresistor was later attached to the sam ple face. It turned out that the tem perature di erence is strongly enhanced below 40 K ,suggesting that the large therm al gradient is due to strong lowering ofthe sam ple therm al conductivity in the SC state.In particular,the lowestsurface tem perature we could achieve was only about 20 K , w hilethecryostatcold \f ngerwasatliquid helium tem perature.T his additionaltem perature calibration has been used in the analysispresented in this paper.H owever,we should note thatthe system aticerrorofthism easurem ent on this rather thick sam ple is about2-3 K .\n\nFig.2 presents the intensity re\n ected from the sam ple at various tem peratures norm alized to the intensity re\n ected at45 K ,i.e.,slightly aboveTc.W e clearly see a rise ofthe re\n ectivity ratio (R R ) above 1,starting below Tc.T his is seen also in Fig.3,w here the tem perature dependences ofthe R R is plotted for \f xed frequencies.T he frequency below w hich the R R starts to increase above 1 shifts to higher values w ith decreasing T;for the low est tem perature T= 20 K the increase starts at around = 70 cm <sup>1</sup> .A sexpected,the R R spectra in the SC state revealm axim a,m eaning that R R = 1 at = 0.\n\nT heobserved variation ofthere\n ectivity isrem iniscent of the behavior found in conventional superconductors and,to a certain extent,in thehigh-tem peraturecuprates.

O n the other hand it has been anticipated that superconducting gap is not uniform and has di erent values for di erent foursheetsofthe Ferm isurface[11].W ith thisinterpretation theR R m axim um should correspond to them inim um value ofthe anisotropic gap.T hisisalso consistentw ith a large variation of2 valuesobtained from tunneling,R am an,photoem ission,and N M R techniques[5,12,13,14,15, 16,17]ranging from 4 to 17 m eV\n\nIn conclusion,we have investigated the opticalproperties ofsintered M gB2 in the norm aland superconducting state by m easuring the ratio of the re\n ected intensity in the superconducting state to that in the norm al state. A n increase of the ratio in the superconducting state is reliably detected and interpreted as the signature ofthe superconducting gap w ith the lowest value of 2 (0) 3 4 m eV .\n\n## References\n\n- 1.
