Posen (Fermilab), M. Liepe (Cornell U.), G. Eremeev (Fermilab), U. Pudasaini (Jefferson Lab), C.E. Reece (Jefferson Lab)\n\n# **Executive summary**\n\nNb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities have substantial potential for enabling new performance capabilities for particle accelerators for high energy physics (HEP), as well as for RF cavity-based detectors for dark matter, gravitational waves, and other quantum sensing applications. Outside of HEP, Nb3Sn SRF cavities can also benefit accelerators for nuclear physics, basic energy sciences, and the industry. The community interest in Nb3Sn SRF is evident from the substantial number of Snowmass 2021 Accelerator Frontier LOIs that discuss Nb3Sn SRF development [1-10].\n\nNb3Sn has approximately twice as high critical temperature as the standard SRF material, niobium, allowing it to achieve high quality factors even at relatively high temperatures. Nb3Sn cavities have already demonstrated extremely high cryogenic efficiency with promising performance for applications with accelerating gradients ~10 MV/m. Small scale accelerators based on Nb3Sn are now moving towards the prototyping stage. Current Nb3Sn cavities show gradient limitation significantly below niobium cavities. The best Nb3Sn cavities so far can reach slightly over ~20 MV/m, but the best niobium cavities can reach ~50 MV/m. However, experiments suggest that even high performing Nb3Sn cavities are limited by surface defects, and improved surfaces are expected to lead to improved gradients. The superheating field of Nb3Sn would correspond to a maximum accelerating gradient of ~100 MV/m, well above the corresponding value for niobium, which is very close to the currently observed limit of ~50 MV/m. The small superconducting coherence length of Nb3Sn ~3-4 nm may mean that RF surfaces need to be significantly smoother than what is currently achieved to reach the full potential. Thinner films may also help to stabilize the Nb3Sn layer against defects. Very limited research has been performed so far on Nb3Sn compared to niobium, for which advanced surface preparation techniques have been developed. Additional investment in Nb3Sn SRF research is needed to help this material reach much closer to its full potential. Nb3Sn R&D efforts are funding limited, but even with relatively small efforts, there have been significant advances in Nb3Sn performance over the last years.\n\nHigh efficiency, medium gradient applications for Nb3Sn include high duty factor accelerators, including e+e- circular colliders and intensity frontier front-end machines. High efficiency, high gradient applications include a future linear collider, such as an energy upgrade to the ILC. Dark sector search applications include RF cavities that achieve high quality factors in multi-tesla fields for axion horoscopes. Industrial applications include wastewater treatment, medical isotope production, and ultrafast electron diffraction.\n\nSupport for Nb3Sn research will be directed towards: continuing to improve understanding of the influence of film microstructure on maximum gradient; improving the coating process to reduce gradient-limiting defects; new coating approaches including multilayers; and practical demonstrations and problems solving of new engineering requirements.\n\n# **Introduction**\n\nSuperconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are extremely efficient devices for generating large electromagnetic fields, which often makes them the technology of choice for transferring energy to beams in modern particle accelerators. Major high energy physics facilities that are based on SRF accelerators include LBNF/DUNE [11], LHC [12], HL-LHC [13], and EIC [14], as well as the proposed next generation Higgs factories ILC [15], FCC-ee [16], and CepC [17]. Normal conducting (NCRF) and SRF cavities can both reach accelerating gradients on the order of 10s of MV/m. The key advantage that superconducting cavities have is their high quality factor Q<sup>0</sup> , which gives them orders of magnitude smaller heat dissipation, allowing them to operate with high duty factor at high fields (e.g. constantly running vs requiring short pulses) and to greatly reduce the amount of overhead from RF power supplies that would be dissipated in the cavity walls.\n\nSRF cavities have been around for over 50 years [18], and all SRF accelerators in use today use niobium as the material in the RF surface. Niobium has been the material of choice because it has good superconducting properties (e.g. high critical temperature ~9.2 K), and, as an element, is easy to fabricate with good stoichiometric uniformity over a large ~1 m 2 surface. Over years of development, new cavity treatments have led to continued improvement in Nb cavity performance. For example, the maximum accelerating gradient of Nb cavities has reached as high as ~50 MV/m [19, 20], which is very close to the predicted ultimate limit set by the superheating field of the superconductor [21, 22, 23].\n\nWhile research continues on improving niobium cavity performance, research effort is also being dedicated in parallel to next-generation SRF cavity materials which have the potential to significantly outperform Nb and thus replace Nb as the prime SRF material. The current most promising and most advanced next-generation material is Nb3Sn [24]. We are therefore expressing here a strong recommendation for increasing support of Nb3Sn SRF research and technology development.\n\n# **Medium term motivation: High Q at high T**\n\nNb3Sn has a critical temperature of ~18 K, about twice that of niobium, allowing it to achieve a high Q0>10 <sup>10</sup> at ~2x higher operating temperatures than Nb. Changing the operating temperature from typical 2.0 K for Nb to 4.4 K for Nb3Sn while maintaining intrinsic quality factors in the 10 10 to 10 11 range would reduce energy consumption and thus cryogenic operating costs by as much as an order of magnitude, and would substantially decrease infrastructure costs for the cryogenic plant.\n\nThis would be a considerable advantage for high duty factor HEP accelerators. This includes circular electron positron colliders, such as FCC-ee [16]. The proposed e+e- circular colliders FCC-ee/CePC would require operation of hundreds of SRF cavities (e.g, at 400 and 800 MHz) for a total RF voltage of multiple GeV; above 10 GeV in ttbar running mode [16]. Employing Nb3Sn based SRF cavities (e.g, Nb3Sn @ 800 MHz @ 4.5K @ 20 MV/m) instead of niobium would allow a substantial reduction in the size and operating cost of the required cryogenic plant, and would make it possible to reduce the overall power consumption of these accelerators considerably.\n\nAnother high energy physics application could be for high duty factor linear accelerators, which are proposed for several future directions. This includes as a driver for future multi-MW neutrino experiments at Fermilab for LBNF/DUNE (an extension to PIP-II, including a possible booster replacement [25]) as well as a driver for a muon collider [26]. It also includes CW electron accelerators for dark matter searches [28, 29].\n\nFor a linear collider (ILC) Higgs Factory and Top Factory upgrade, high-Q, high-temperature Nb3Sn could enable increasing the RF pulse length as well as the repetition rate of the pulses, thereby greatly increasing luminosity.\n\n#### **Long term motivation: Potential for high gradient operation**\n\nNb3Sn also has a predicted superheating field that is twice as high as niobium [23], which could allow for a similar increase in the maximum accelerating field, up to 100 MV/m. If this could be realized practically, it would be an enormous advantage for high energy linac applications such as an energy upgrade for the ILC to multi-TeV (see also separate LOI on ILC high-energy upgrade [30]).\n\nFor some schemes of proton drivers for neutrino and muon based physics, a short duty factor pulsed linear accelerator is called for. High accelerating gradient could help to reduce linac length and cost in this case.\n\nExceeding the current ~20 MV/m of Nb3Sn cavities would also greatly benefit the high duty factor HEP accelerator discussed above. The small wall dissipation (high Q0) of Nb3Sn will allow operating high duty factor SRF cavities at substantially higher optimal field gradients than standard niobium cavities, thereby reducing the number of SRF cavities required, and in turn reducing the impedance of the accelerator.\n\n# **Additional motivation: Dark sector searches**\n\nSRF cavities are also being explored not as a means of accelerating particles but as a means for detecting them in the next generation of dark sector searches [31-34]. Nb3Sn could have a distinct advantage for these searches due to its ability to remain superconducting in large magnetic fields, which would be important for example for axion haloscopes. Initial results have been promising, showing Q<sup>0</sup> values of ~5x10 <sup>5</sup> at 6 T and 4.2 K [35]. Successfully implementing cavities with these Q<sup>0</sup> values (while keeping other parameters the same) in an axion search would significantly improve sensitivity and scan rate compared to typical copper cavities.\n\n#### **Motivation Outside of HEP**\n\nNb3Sn cavities have a very high quality factor even above 4 K. They can be cooled with cryocoolers for cavity cooling, which significantly cuts capital and installation cost, enabling compact and potentially even mobile applications. For small-scale applications, Nb3Sn SRF opens up the possibility for turn-key operation with cryocoolers instead of complex liquid helium cryogenic plants. This greatly reduces the footprint of the system, and substantially simplifies operation and maintenance.\n\nThere are expected to be applications in nuclear physics facilities for small Nb3Sn cryomodules, especially cryocooler-based modules for a small number of cavities that are in an isolated location not near an existing cryogenic distribution system, for example for isotope separation. A specific example of an application already underway is at JLab, for the upgraded injector test facility (UITF), where a quarter cryomodule can be used to accelerate an electron beam up to 10 MeV. The facility can use a cryomodule with Nb3Sn-coated cavities to run low-energy nuclear physics experiments. Installing a 4 K capable cryounit at the front of CEBAF would allow year-round injector development operations, while the rest of the accelerator is down for servicing. One can dream about running the facility using cryocoolers at 4 K\n\nwith Nb3Sn cavities instead with cryogenic at 2 K. Developing an Nb3Sn quarter module suitable to install and test into the UITF with Nb3Sn cavities is in progress.\n\nIn a similar way, Nb3Sn cavity units could further enable and greatly simplify widespread use of SRF technology in light-source storage rings (e.g., a cryocooler based single-cell Nb3Sn 500 MHz cavity cryomodule), FELs, and compact accelerators for biosciences and material science, e.g., using ultrafast electron diffraction (UED).\n\nThere have been tests of Nb3Sn cavities operating in conduction cooling setups as demonstrations for industrial accelerator applications at Fermilab, JLab, and Cornell [36-38]. The Fermilab demonstration was a Nb3Sn coating on an all-niobium 650 MHz single cell cavity with welded conduction cooling rings. JLab tested a Nb3Sn coating on a 1.5 GHz single cell cavity, with a copper layer deposited on the outer side by cold-spray (∼of 76 µm) followed by copper plating (>= 5 mm) for conduction cooling. The Cornell demonstration was on a Nb3Sn-coated 2.6 GHz single cell Nb cavity with cooling links clamped to its beamtubes.\n\nThere are also ongoing efforts to build demonstration Nb3Sn cryomodules for industrial applications. Detailed plans have been published for a medium energy, high average power superconducting e-beam accelerator for environmental applications by researchers at Fermilab [39] and a a cw, low-energy, high-power superconducting linac for environmental applications by researchers at JLab [40]. A conduction-cooled Nb3Sn SRF cryomodule housing a single-cell 1.3 GHz cavity capable of 100 mA beam operation is currently under development at Cornell University. Euclid Techlabs is leading an effort to build a Nb3Sn cryomodule for ultrafast electron microscopy applications [41].\n\n# **Current landscape for Nb3Sn R&D**\n\nIn the U.S, the Department of Energy started funding Nb3Sn R&D initially at Cornell University, followed by programs at Jefferson Lab and Fermilab [24]. Stimulated by the Nb3Sn SRF progress at these laboratories with first proof-of-principle demonstrations of superior performance, worldwide interest in Nb3Sn SRF has greatly increased recently, and new Nb3Sn R&D efforts have started at labs and in industry, *e.g.* at CERN, IMP, ULVAC/KEK, NHMFL/Florida State University/University of Texas–Arlington, Peking University, STFC, ODU, and Ultramet [42-49].\n\nNb3Sn cavity performance has not reached its ultimate performance potential discussed above yet, but it has been making substantial progress over the past years. Using as a metric the maximum accelerating gradient with Q0>10 <sup>10</sup> at 4.4 K, cavities have increased from ~5 MV/m in the 1990s [50] to ~13 MV/m in 2014 [51], to ~18 MV/m in 2015 [52], to ~24 MV/m in 2020 [53]. This has come with corresponding improvements in understanding of the materials science and fabrication methods for the Nb3Sn coatings [54-61].\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art Nb3Sn cavities show gradient limitation significantly below niobium cavities. The best Nb3Sn cavities so far can reach slightly over ~20 MV/m, but the best niobium cavities can reach ~50 MV/m. However, experiments suggest that even high performing Nb3Sn cavities are limited by surface defects [62,63], and improved surfaces are expected to lead to improved gradients. The superheating field of Nb3Sn would correspond to a maximum accelerating gradient of ~100 MV/m, well above the corresponding value for niobium, which is very close to the currently observed limit of ~50 MV/m. Nb3Sn is expected to be more sensitive to surface defects than niobium because of its relatively short coherence length ~3-4 nm, approximately an order of magnitude smaller than niobium, depending on the niobium surface treatment. On the other hand, Nb3Sn R&D on surface treatments after coating is\n\nstill relatively primitive compared to niobium. Coated surfaces are relatively rough on relevant length scales, and attempts to smooth surfaces using techniques developed for niobium have so far resulted in other issues such as residues and performance degradation [64,65].\n\nCompared to niobium, relatively little effort has so far been invested in surface processing of Nb3Sn. New efforts are underway to smoothen Nb3Sn surfaces and also make the coatings thinner, which could help to thermally stabilize any defects that are present by reducing thermal impedance. There are promising directions, including electropolishing, oxypolishing, and mechanical polishing, as well as new deposition methods to try to create inherently smoother films.\n\nAccording to the concept proposed by A. Gurevich [66], it is possible to significantly enhance the RF breakdown of the magnetic field of SRF cavity by engineering multilayer thin film of alternating insulating layers of superconducting layers of thickness smaller than the London penetration depth. Nb3Sn is a potential thin film to be used in such multilayer structures. For example, it has been estimated that the optimized thickness of the ideal Nb3Sn and insulating layer can result in a maximum field of 400 mT compared to 200 mT [67]. Despite an attractive approach, it is significantly challenging to deposit defect-free layers of superconductors and insulators. Recent progress of novel deposition techniques such as energetic ion vacuum deposition, atomic layer deposition, etc. allows producing well-engineered single superconducting layer (e.g., Nb on Cu) or multilayered superconductor-insulator-superconductor structures. Research is progressing toward developing SRF cavities deposited with high-quality Nb and multilayer structures based on Nb3Sn using energetic ion deposition to avoid high-temperature treatment and result in high-quality material layers.\n\nSuperconducting radiofrequency technology relies on niobium and its superconducting properties to achieve the gradient and quality factor specifications of accelerator projects. After decades of research, niobium material has been pushed close to the superheating field of what is expected from an ultrapure niobium material. To overcome this limit and to achieve higher RF fields several ideas have been put forth on how to modify the surface and material within the penetration depth. As an example, a paper by Ngampruetikorn and Sauls [68] discusses how inhomogeneous surface disorder can increase the superheating field above that for a clean surface. The authors argue that an inhomogeneous disorder, e.g., an impurity diffusion layer, can increase the superheating field above that in the clean limit by distributing the screening currents into cleaner regions with larger critical currents, hence, achieve a higher surface superheating field. While these ideas typically analyze niobium, the underlying ideas apply not only to niobium, but also other superconductors such as Nb3Sn. A long-term R&D in Nb3Sn can exploit, verify this.\n\n#### **Technology Development**\n\nThe potential for Nb3Sn material requires further focused R&D to enable even higher accelerating gradients and quality factors. Some of the development challenges for accelerating modules become evident only during engineering and technical developments of operational accelerating modules. One of the challenges that has not been evident during the superconducting material development phase is the mechanical deformation sensitivity of Nb3Sn films coated on niobium in the vapor diffusion process. This sensitivity, which was identified during assembly of accelerating structures into the accelerating module[69], limits the amount of tuning that can be applied to a coated cavity and may require different tuning schemes to tune the frequency of accelerating structures to the accelerator frequency. Further efforts are needed at both the scientific and technical level to identify and resolve such issues as discussed\n\nin the next section. If funded, the synergy of such efforts will enable timely deployment of the latest advances in the fundamental development in the material to the practical units.\n\nBesides elliptical cavities, Nb3Sn has the potential to be used in cavities of complicated geometries such as twin axis cavities, half coaxial resonators, etc., to simplify their application in various SRF accelerator applications. Because of advanced geometry with hard-to-reach areas, conformal thin film deposition uniformly inside these cavities is challenging. After the vapor deposition of Nb3Sn at a higher temperature, these cavities are prone to mechanical deformation. At Jefferson Lab, a twin axis cavity was coated, but failed mechanically after the coating on its way to RF testing. Additional engineering effort is needed to design the coating process and preserve the mechanical integrity of the twin-axis cavity after coating until the application.\n\nOperating of Nb3Sn with cryocoolers for compact, stand-alone applications calls for development and optimization of effective conduction cooling of SRF cavities. Cryomodule concepts will have to be developed that are optimized for this novel cavity cooling method, with low static heat loads, but also the potential for significant simplifications as compared to cryogen based SRF modules. High beam power operation of such cryocooler conduction-cooled Nb3Sn cavity modules will need high-power RF input couplers with low static and dynamic heat loads.\n\n# **Recommendation for continued investment in Nb3Sn**\n\nSuperconducting RF is a key technology for future HEP accelerators. With continued investment into Nb3Sn SRF cavity R&D, next-generation cavities based on Nb3Sn will become a reality with performance specifications highly beneficial for HEP applications, enabling higher luminosity, higher energy, and facilitating energy sustainable science.\n\nContinued investment in Nb3Sn cavity R&D will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students in SRF science and technology. SRF experts are a critical need for the future of the U.S. national accelerator labs, and soon will be for industry providing and employing SRF technology based on Nb3Sn. The U.S. DOE funded Nb3Sn research program has already graduated several scientists in SRF with broad, hands-on expertise. As such, continued Nb3Sn research will not only provide next-generation technology needed for future accelerator facilities, but also the future leaders that will help develop - and ultimately bring to reality - the accelerators that will drive the HEP research program as well as the research program in a wide range of other sciences over the next decades.\n\nFunding should address both fundamental developments in superconducting Nb3Sn material, supporting material deposition techniques, surface and RF research, and should also address technical challenges, supporting system-level developments (e.g., tuning systems). Practical accelerating modules, exploiting the state-of-the-art Nb3Sn technology, require both developments in material performance and auxiliary component development to operate in this novel mode. Funding to both fundamental and engineering development needs to be expanded and provided to deliver practical useful accelerator units for the future accelerators.\n\n## **Conclusions**\n\nThe unique advantages of Nb3Sn cavities make them an exciting prospect for future HEP experiments. They already achieve high Q<sup>0</sup> at 4.4 K at accelerating gradients that are useful for high duty factor applications, including first demonstrations in large, accelerator-scale structures [53, 56]. Efforts are underway, including support from sources outside of typical HEP basic research funding, including\nSBIRs [41], the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) to develop first practical small-scale accelerators based on Nb3Sn. Success in first applications would make Nb3Sn attractive for high duty factor linear accelerators, with possible applications in high energy physics that include circular colliders and high intensity drivers for neutrino- and muon-based physics. With continued materials development progress, Nb3Sn cavities have the potential to further reduce cryogenic losses and also to eventually outperform current state-of-the-art niobium in energy gain by a significant margin for high energy linear accelerator applications. Initial investigations show that Nb3Sn cavities are promising for dark sector searches requiring a high magnetic field [35], showing high Q<sup>0</sup> in multi-tesla fields, and a corresponding increase in detector sensitivity and scan rate. Continued development could help to increase Q<sup>0</sup> even further in this high magnetic field regime. We ask the Snowmass community to strongly endorse continued investment into Nb3Sn SRF cavity R&D so that the potential of this material can be realized and exploited for high energy physics, nuclear physics, basic energy sciences, and industrial accelerators.\n\n## **References**\n\n[1] C.

Outside of HEP, Nb3Sn SRF cavities can also benefit accelerators for nuclear physics, basic energy sciences, and the industry. In this contribution to Snowmass 2021, we overview the potential, status, and outlook of Nb3Sn SRF cavities.",
