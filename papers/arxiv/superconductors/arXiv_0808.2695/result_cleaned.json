From the analysis of T dependence of ,we have estim ated severalnorm al-state param eters usefulfor understanding the origin ofsuperconductivity in this system . O ur resultssuggest that Fe-based oxypnictides are phonon m ediated BC S superconductorslike C hevrelphasesand A 15 com pounds.\n\n### I.IN T R O D U C T IO N\n\nThe discovery ofiron-based layered oxypnictide LaFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>x</sup> with high superconducting transition tem perature (Tc) 26 K has stim ulated intense experim entaland theoretical activities in the \f eld of superconductivity [\\[1](#page-10-0), [2](#page-10-1)]. Following the initial report, attem pts have been m ade to enhance T<sup>c</sup> m ainly by changing the sam ple com position. It has been shown thatT<sup>c</sup> increases signi\f cantly when La is replaced by other rare earth elem ents (R ) ofsm aller ionic size such as Ce,Pr,N d,Sm ,etc [\\[3](#page-10-2)[,4](#page-10-3)[,5](#page-10-4)[,6](#page-10-5)[,7](#page-10-6)].T<sup>c</sup> as high as 55 K has been reached in this class ofm aterials,which is the highest after cuprate superconductors. The stoichiom etric com pound R FeA sO is a nonsuperconducting m etal,undergoes a structural phase transition around Ts= 150 K and exhibits a long-range antiferrom agnetic ordering of Fe m om ents slightly below Ts[\\[1](#page-10-0)[,8\\]](#page-10-7). Partialsubstitution of\nuorine for oxygen or creating oxygen vacancy suppresses both structuraland m agnetic phase transitions,and drives the system to a superconducting ground state.Besideshigh transition tem perature,thissystem exhibits m any interesting phenom ena possibly due to its layered structure as in the case of high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates and the presence ofiron. At room -tem perature,the crystalstructure of R FeA sO is tetragonalwith space group P 4=nm m and it consists ofR O and FeA s layers which are stacked along the c axis. In spite of high transition tem perature and layered structure, there are som e im portant di erences with respect to cuprate superconductors. For oxypnictides, the parent com pound is not a M ott insulator and the superconductingstate properties are insensitive to oxygen or \nuorine content over a wide range. A nother im portant di erence between high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates and oxypnictides is the dependence ofT<sup>c</sup> on the ionic size ofrare earth ion. U nlike high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates,the present system shows thatT<sup>c</sup> increases with the decrease ofionic radius ofrare earth ion [\\[7\\]](#page-10-6). M oreover, the sym m etry and tem perature dependence ofgap in these two system s are not sam e. The gap function ofthe latteriss-wave and isconsistent with the BCS theory [\\[9](#page-10-8)[,10\\]](#page-10-9).\n\nSeveraltheoreticaland experim entalattem pts aim ed at identifying the possible superconducting m echanism in oxypnictides have been m ade [\\[9](#page-10-8)[,10](#page-10-9)[,11,](#page-10-10)[12,](#page-10-11)[13,](#page-10-12)[14,](#page-10-13)[15,](#page-10-14)[16,](#page-10-15)[17\\]](#page-10-16). The high transition tem perature,structuralsim ilarities with cuprates and the occurrence ofsuperconductivity on the verge ofa ferrom agnetic instability led to speculate that the superconductivity in this system is unconventional. M ost ofthe theoreticalreports suggest\n\nthatsuperconductivity in oxypnictidesisnotm ediated by phonon [\\[12](#page-10-11)[,13](#page-10-12)[,14](#page-10-13)[,15](#page-10-14)[,16\\]](#page-10-15).Boeri et al. [\\[15](#page-10-14)]calculated the value of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant tr= 0.21 for pure LaFeA sO using the standard M igdal-Eliashberg theory and concluded that tr should be even sm aller for the \nuorine-doped superconducting sam ples. A ccording to them , the m axim um value ofT<sup>c</sup> due to the e-ph coupling should not be above 0.8 K and a 5-6 tim es larger coupling constant would be needed to reproduce the experim entalvalue ofT<sup>c</sup> in this system . In contrast to this,Eschrig [\\[17\\]](#page-10-16)argued in favor ofstrong e-ph coupling ofthe Fe inplane breathing m ode for the high transition tem perature in this system . Chen etal. [\\[9\\]](#page-10-8) from the A ndreev re\nection spectroscopy and K ondo et al. [\\[10\\]](#page-10-9) from the angle resolved photoem ission spectroscopy,have shown s-wave sym m etry ofthe order param eter as in the case of phonon m ediated conventional superconductors. The tem perature dependence of energy gap is also consistent with the BCS theory. To shed som e light on the m echanism of superconductivity, we have m easured the tem perature dependence of resistivity up to 550 K for PrFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>y</sup> sam ples. From the analysis ofhigh-tem perature resistivity, the e-ph coupling strength for the superconducting and nonsuperconducting sam ples has been estim ated. Indeed, we observe that tr is quite sm all (0.24) for the nonsuperconducting sam ple in accordance with the theoretical prediction but it is 5-6 tim es larger for the superconducting sam ples.\n\n### II.SA M P LE P R E PA R A T IO N A N D E X P E R IM E N TA L T E C H N IQ U E S\n\nG ood quality single phase sam ples are necessary for understanding the norm al-state transport properties and the m echanism ofsuperconductivity in this system . U sually,two m ethods have been followed for the preparation of iron-based oxypnictides. U sing highpressure synthesis technique,one can obtain \nuorine-free and oxygen-de\f cient R FeA sO<sup>1</sup> superconducting sam ples [\\[18](#page-10-17), [19](#page-11-0)]. H owever, sam ples prepared in this m ethod contain appreciable am ount of im purity phases resulting from the unreacted ingredients. In the other m ethod, oxygen is partially replaced by \nuorine and the sam ple is prepared either in high vacuum or in the presence ofinert gas. Though sam ples prepared in this m ethod are superior in quality,they are not always free from im purity phases [\\[20,](#page-11-1)[21\\]](#page-11-2). W e use a slightly di erent m ethod for the preparation of superconducting PrFeA sO<sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>y</sup> sam ples. The nom inalcom position forthese sam plesisoxygen de\f cientand atthe sam e tim e oxygen\n\n3\n\nis partially replaced by a sm all am ount of \nuorine (x 6= y 6= 0). W e observe that single phase sam ples with x 0.4 can be prepared in this m ethod. Polycrystalline sam ples of nom inal com positions PrFeA sO , PrFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>6</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup> and PrFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>7</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup> were prepared by conventionalsolid-state reaction m ethod. H igh purity chem icals Pr (99.9% ),Fe (99.998% ), Fe2O <sup>3</sup> (99.99% ),A s (99.999% ),PrF<sup>3</sup> (99.9% ) and Pr6O <sup>11</sup> (99.99% ) from A lfa-A esar were used for the sam ple preparation. Finely grounded powders ofPr<sup>0</sup>:<sup>96</sup>A s,Fe,Fe2O <sup>3</sup>,Pr6O <sup>11</sup> (pre-heated at 600 <sup>o</sup>C) and PrF<sup>3</sup> were thoroughly m ixed in appropriate ratios and then pressed into pellets. The pellets were wrapped with Ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. They were then annealed at 1250 <sup>o</sup>C for 36 h. Pr<sup>0</sup>:<sup>96</sup>A s was obtained by slowly reacting Pr chips and A s pieces \f rst at 850 <sup>o</sup>C for 24 h and then at 950 <sup>o</sup>C for another 24 h in an evacuated quartz tube. The product was reground,pressed into pellets and then sealed again in a quartz tube and heated at 1150 <sup>o</sup>C for about 24 h. The phase purity and the room -tem perature structuralparam eters were determ ined by powder x-ray di raction (X R D ) m ethod with Cu K radiation. dc m agnetization and electrical resistivity m easurem entsup to 300 K were done using a Q uantum D esign PhysicalProperty M easurem ent System (PPM S).H igh tem perature resistivity above 300 K was m easured in a hom e-m ade set-up. R esistivity was m easured by standard four-probe technique. In order to avoid oxidation,resistivity m easurem ents athigh tem peratureswere done in vacuum .\n\n### III.E X P E R IM E N TA L R E SU LT S A N D D ISC U SSIO N\n\n### A .P ow der x-ray diraction analysis\n\nFigure 1 shows the X R D pattern forthe \nuorine-doped PrFeA sO<sup>0</sup>:<sup>6</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup> sam ple atroom tem perature. N o im purity phase was observed forx= 0.3 and 0.4 sam ples. The di raction pattern can be wellindexed on the basis oftetragonalZrCuSiA s-type structure with the space group P4/nm m . The lattice param eters obtained from the R ietveld re\f nem ents are a= 3.9711 A and c= 8.5815 A. These values of lattice param eters are com parable with those reported for \nuorine-doped and oxygen-de\f cient PrFeA sO sam ple[s \\[5](#page-10-4)[,18](#page-10-17)]. A s expected,the lattice param etersofthe presentsam ples are located between CeFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>x</sup> and N dFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>x</sup> [\\[4,](#page-10-3) [19](#page-11-0)]. The deduced bond lengths are d(Pr-O /F)= 2.3405, d(Pr-A s)= 3.3008,d(A s-Fe)= 2.3828,and d(Fe-Fe)= 2.8081 A. The values ofseveralbond angles\n\nare hO /F-Pr-A si= 76.57,hO /F-Pr-O /Fi= 73.73,hPr-A s-Fei= 77.83,hFe-A s-Fei= 72.20, and hA s-Fe-A si= 107.79<sup>o</sup>. W e would like to m ention here that the Fe-Fe distance in the present system isabout1.4 % sm allerthan the Fe-Fe distance 2.8481 A in LaFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>x</sup> [\\[20\\]](#page-11-1).\n\n### B .E lectricalresistivity analysis\n\nThe m easured tem perature dependence of resistivity for PrFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>6</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup> (S1) and PrFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>7</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup> (S2) sam ples in the tem perature range of 45-550 K is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).Forboth the sam ples, decreasesinitially ata very slow rate and then ata fasterrate with decreasing tem perature untilthe superconducting onset tem perature (T on <sup>c</sup> 50 K ) is reached. Below T on <sup>c</sup> , drops sharply and becom es zero at around 47 K .The inset displays the enlarged view of the onset of superconductivity for sam ple S1. For this sam ple, the transition width T<sup>c</sup> is 2.7 K ,where T<sup>c</sup> is de\f ned as the width ofa transition between 10% and 90% ofthe norm al-state resistivity. ForS1 sam ple,we have m easured \f eld-cooled (FC) and zero-\f eld-cooled (ZFC) m agnetic susceptibilities at H = 50 O e. The values of shielding and M eissnerfractionsdeterm ined from FC and ZFC are65 and 23 % ,respectively at5 K .The resistivity ratio (300 K )/ (54 K )ofthese sam ples isabout13.The resistivity ratio and the transition width are respectively larger and narrower as com pared to that reported forother\nuorine-doped and oxygen-de\f cient PrFeA sO sam ple[s\\[5](#page-10-4)[,18](#page-10-17)].The larger resistivity ratio and narrower transition width are the indications ofhigh sam ple quality. W e have also determ ined the approxim ate value ofresidualresistivity forS1, (0) 0.10 m cm ,by extrapolating the vsT curve between 150 and 60 K to T= 0.Itm ay be m entioned that we have prepared another sam ple with nom inal oxygen content 0.50. The value of resistivity ratio for this sam ple is also large ( 9) and its T<sup>c</sup> is alm ost sam e as that for S1 and S2. H owever,x-ray di raction shows the presence ofim purity phases in this sam ple. K ito et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)]prepared N d-based superconducting sam ples using high-pressure synthesis technique and found that the am ount ofim purity phases increase rapidly when the oxygen vacancy exceeds 0.4. This suggests that sam ples with oxygen de\f ciency m ore than 0.4 can not be prepared in single phase. Though both the m agnitude and T dependence of norm al-state resistivity depend to som e extent on com position and purity ofthe sam ples, T<sup>c</sup> is m ore or less insensitive to oxygen content. This observation is consistent with the\n\n5\n\nreported phase diagram T<sup>c</sup> vs \nuorine oroxygen content [\\[1](#page-10-0)[,19](#page-11-0)].\n\nThe analysisofT dependence of revealsthree di erenttem perature regim es. exhibits a quadratic tem perature dependence, = (0)+ A T <sup>2</sup>,in the range 70 K T 150 K while it is linear in T in the interm ediate region, 170 K T 270 K . The T <sup>2</sup> behavior of below 150 K indicates a strong electronic correlation and is consistent with the form ation of a Ferm i-liquid state. A bove 270 K , the resistivity behavior shows m arked departure from the usual tem perature dependence of sim ple m etals and high-T<sup>c</sup> superconductors. N orm ally,in good m etals, is linear in T at high tem perature due to the e-ph scattering. For the present sam ples, the slope of (T) curve decreases continuously with increasing tem perature above 270 K and a saturationlike behaviorappearsathighertem perature [Fig. 2(b)]. For sam ple S1, the increase of is sm all while is e ectively T-independent for sam ple S2 above 500 K [Fig. 2(c)]. The saturationlike behavior of at high tem perature at once draw our attention to the T dependence of for N b, Chevrel phases, several interm etallic and A 15 com pounds [\\[22\\]](#page-11-3). This phenom enon has been explained on the basis ofthe conduction-electron m ean free path approaching a lower lim it with the consequent breakdown of the classical Boltzm ann theory [\\[23\\]](#page-11-4). The breakdown has been interpreted in term s ofthe Io e-R egelcriterion [\\[24](#page-11-5)]. The electron m ean free path can not be shorter than the interatom ic distance. The resistivity ofpoor m etals at high tem peratures tends to saturate to a tem perature-independent value when the m ean free path lapproaches the wavelength <sup>F</sup> = 2=k<sup>F</sup> associated with the Ferm ilevel,where k<sup>F</sup> is the Ferm iwave vector. The Io e-R egelcriterion forthe onset ofthis saturation isk<sup>F</sup> l 1. In the latter section,we willshow thatthis criterion isindeed satis\f ed in the present case.\n\nFigure 3 shows the tem perature dependence of resistivity for the undoped PrFeA sO sam ple. O ne can see that the behavior of (T) for the parent sam ple is very di erent from that of its superconducting counter part. A n anom alous peak at T<sup>s</sup> 155 K in is associated with the structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhom bic with decreasing tem perature. Below Ts,resistivity data can be \f tted wellwith an expression, = (0)+ aT <sup>n</sup>,with n close to 1.5. H owever, increases linearly with T from 250 K up to 525 K atthe rate of 1.5 cm /K .N o saturationlike behaviorisobserved forthissam ple\n\nin the m easured tem perature range. Thus,the behavior of at high tem perature for the nonsuperconducting sam ple is quite di erent from that ofthe superconducting sam ple. In the linear region of vs T curves,the slope for the nonsuperconducting parent com pound isabout6 tim es sm aller than thatforthe superconducting sam ple ( 8.6 cm /K ).\n\nForthe quantitative understanding ofthe behaviorof (T)athigh tem perature,we estim ate severalnorm al-state transportparam eters related to the e-ph scattering and exam ine its e ect on superconductivity as it was done in the case ofcuprate superconductors [\\[25\\]](#page-11-6). Expressing resistivity in term sofplasm a energy (h!p), (T)= 4=(! 2 <sup>p</sup> )= 4v<sup>F</sup> =(! 2 <sup>p</sup>l),where v<sup>F</sup> is the Ferm ivelocity [\\[26\\]](#page-11-7). At high tem perature,where resistivity is linear in T, is the e-ph scattering tim e ep,and is given by h=ep = 2trkT [\\[26](#page-11-7)]. tr is closely related to the coupling constant that determ ines the superconducting transition tem perature. In the case ofN b and Pd it is found that tr di ers from by about 10% [\\[22\\]](#page-11-3). From the above relationsone can deduce\n\n$$\\mathbf{h}\\_{\\text{tr}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{h}\\_{\\text{p}}^{\\text{\\text{\\textdegree}}} \\mathbf{d}}{\\text{\\textdegree }^2 \\text{\\text{\\textdegree}}^2 \\text{\\text{\\textdegree}}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{T} \\tag{\\text{\\textdegree}}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\mathbf{l} = \\frac{\\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}}{2} \\mathbf{:} \\tag{2}$$\n\nW e can calculate tr using the values of resistivity slope (8.6 cm /K ) in the linear region and plasm a energy ( 0.8 eV ) determ ined from the inplane penetration depth [\\[27\\]](#page-11-8). Eq.(1)reveals tr = 1.3.Such a large value of tr suggeststhatthe e-ph coupling strength in this system is quite strong. U sing this value of tr and Ferm ivelocity v<sup>F</sup> = 1.3 10<sup>7</sup> cm /s calculated from band theory [\\[12\\]](#page-10-11),we \f nd l 2.5A at 500 K .This value oflis com parable to the Fe-Fe separation.W e observe thatthe Io e-R egelcriterion forthe onsetofsaturation k<sup>F</sup> l 1 is satis\f ed in this case. k<sup>F</sup> was deduced using the values ofFerm ienergy (E<sup>F</sup> = 0.4 eV ) and Ferm ivelocity,as wellas from the experim entalvalue ofcarrier density (n= 10<sup>21</sup> cm <sup>3</sup>) reported for LaFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>x</sup> with free electron approxim ation [\\[12](#page-10-11),[20](#page-11-1)]. In the case of layered system , one can also check the Io e-R egel criterion solely from the resistivity data using the relation k<sup>F</sup> l (hc=4e <sup>2</sup>)/ ,where c is the interlayer distance. If we use the value of at500 K and c= 8.6 A,then also k<sup>F</sup> l< 1.Thus,the e-ph scattering is dom inating\n\nthe high tem perature resistivity and the large value of tr is consistent with the resistivity saturation.\n\nH aving acquired the qualitative and quantitative knowledge on norm al-state transport properties,we now discuss the role ofe-ph coupling on superconductivity. In the lim it of strong e-ph coupling,onecan usetheM cM illan equation [\\[28](#page-11-9)]to estim atethesuperconducting transition tem perature\n\n$$\\mathbf{T\\_c = \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{145}} \\exp\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\hline \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{array} \\right] \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{1404} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1+} & \\mathbf{1} \\\\ \\hline \\ \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1}: \\tag{3}$$\n\nwhere is the Coulom b pseudopotentialand - <sup>D</sup> is the D ebye tem perature. A ssum ing 0 and = tr= 1.3 and using thereported valueof- <sup>D</sup> = 355 K forPrFeA sO [\\[29\\]](#page-11-10)we\f nd that Tc= 41 K .ThisvalueofT<sup>c</sup> isonly few K elvin lowerthan the observed T<sup>c</sup> forPrFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>6</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>12</sup>. N evertheless, the estim ated and observed values of T<sup>c</sup> are com parable in this class of m aterials. A m ore accurate estim ation ofT<sup>c</sup> can be m ade using the A llen-D ynes equation [\\[30](#page-11-11)]where the prefactor - <sup>D</sup> =1:45 in Eq. (3) is replaced by !ln/1.2. A s we do not have any knowledgeon thevalueof!ln forPrFeA sO ,T<sup>c</sup> can notbededuced using thisequation forthe presentsystem .Ifweassum ethate-ph interaction doesnotchangesigni\f cantly from system to system then using the sam e value 1.3 for tr along with theoretically derived !ln= 206 K for LaFeA sO [\\[15](#page-10-14)],surprisingly the observed value ofTc= 27 K for LaFeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>89</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>11</sup> can be reproduced.N ow,we would like to com m enton the dependence ofT<sup>c</sup> on the rare earth ionic size in R FeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>Fx.In oxypnictide superconductors,ithasbeen reported thatthe lattice param eter a decreases while T<sup>c</sup> increases when La is replaced by sm aller rare earth ions [\\[18](#page-10-17)].The decrease ofa m eansthe decrease ofFe-Fe distance.Thus,one expectsan increase in characteristic phonon frequency and hence T<sup>c</sup> with the decrease of ionic radius of R . Thisobservation isconsistentwith the phonon-m ediated superconductivity butquite di erentfrom thatofcupratesuperconductorswhereT<sup>c</sup> isnotsensitiveto therareearth ionicsize.\n\nItm ay be interesting to com pare tr deduced from the resistivity data with the theoretically predicted valuesforunderstanding theroleofe-ph interaction in Fe-based oxypnictides and sim ilar m aterials. In m ost of the reports, these Fe-based m aterials are com m only viewed as unconventionalsuperconductors because oftheir high transition tem perature in\nspite ofthe predicted weak e-ph coupling and the occurrence ofsuperconductivity in close proxim ity to m agnetism [\\[12](#page-10-0)[,13](#page-10-1)[,14](#page-10-2)[,15](#page-10-3)[,16\\]](#page-10-4).Forthe undoped com pound,the value (0.21)of the e-ph coupling strength calculated from band theory [\\[15](#page-10-3)]is com parable with that (0.24) obtained from the resistivity data.H owever,there isa large disagreem entin the value of tr determ ined from the resistivity data with the theoreticalprediction forthe superconducting sam ple. A ccording to the band structure calculation, the value of tr does not change signi\f cantly as one goes from the undoped to the doped sam ple,though,a 5-6 tim es larger coupling constant ( tr= 1.0-1.3)is needed to reproduce the experim entalvalue ofT<sup>c</sup> in this system [\\[15\\]](#page-10-3). O n the contrary,if tr does not change signi\f cantly, it is not clear why the behavior of resistivity changes so dram atically with a sm all am ount of \nuorine doping. Eschrig [\\[17](#page-10-5)]pointed out severalshortcom ings ofthe standard band structure calculations and argued that the e-ph coupling in this system is quite strong due to the Fe inplane breathing m ode. D rechsler etal. [\\[11](#page-10-6)]also cast doubt on the calculated weak value ofe-ph coupling.The gap function isthe single m ostim portantquantity thatcan be used to reveal the pairing m echanism ofa superconductor. Chen etal. [\\[9\\]](#page-10-7)studied A ndreev spectroscopy on Sm FeA sO <sup>0</sup>:<sup>85</sup>F<sup>0</sup>:<sup>15</sup> and observed a single nodeless gap with nearly isotropic in size across di erentsectionsofthe Ferm isurface.The value ofthenorm alized gap param eter(2=kTc) determ ined by them was 3.68 which is slightly larger than the BCS prediction of3.52 in the weak coupling regim e butclose to thatobserved in m any conventionalsuperconductors with strong e-ph coupling such as N b, V3Si, etc [\\[9,](#page-10-7) [31\\]](#page-11-0). A lso, the T dependence of the gap is consistent with the BCS prediction, but dram atically di erent from that of the pseudogap in the cuprate superconductors. From these observations,they concluded that the structure ofgap is not com patible with theoreticalm odels involving antiferrom agnetic\n\n uctuations,strong electronic correlations,thet-J m odel,and thatproposed forthecuprate superconductors. Isotropic s-wave sym m etry of the gap has also been established from the angle resolved photo em ission spectroscopy [\\[10\\]](#page-10-8). It has been argued that the isotropic nature ofgap and the appearance ofsuperconductivity in close proxim ity to a suppressed structuralphase transition together with the observation ofsuperconductivity in CaFe2A s<sup>2</sup> with application ofa m odestpressure bring the role ofphonon in these Fe-based sam plesto the forefront[\\[10\\]](#page-10-8).\n\nThe strong deviation of resistivity from linearity to saturationlike in superconducting oxypnictides im m ediately draw our attention to conventionalsuperconductors where e-ph coupling is strong such as in A 15 com pounds and Chevrelphases [\\[22\\]](#page-11-1). In these cases, shows a saturationlike behavior at high tem peratures and the values of tr,in general,are quite large and com parable with that ofthe present system [\\[31](#page-11-0)]. It m ay be im portant to m ention that apart from tr, other param eters related to superconductivity such as the density ofstates at the Ferm ilevel,the m agnitude and T dependence of2=kT<sup>c</sup> and the sym m etry ofgap-param eter ofthese system s are com parable to oxypnictides [\\[31](#page-11-0)]. The T dependence ofgap param eter is com patible with the BCS prediction in both the cases. So by com paring these system s with the presentone itisapparentthatoxypnictides belong to a class ofstrongly coupled BCS superconductors.\n\n## IV .C O N C LU SIO N S\n\nIn conclusion, we have analyzed the tem perature dependence of resistivity of PrFeA sO <sup>1</sup> <sup>x</sup>F<sup>y</sup> sam ples. For nonsuperconducting PrFeA sO , below 155 K shows a power-law behavior whereas in the high tem perature region (250-525K ), is linear in T. For superconducting sam ples, above T<sup>c</sup> crosses over from T <sup>2</sup> dependence due to the electron-electron interaction to linear in T and then to a saturationlike behavior at higher tem perature due to the e-ph interaction. The resistivity saturation indicates that the e-ph interaction is strong and the conduction-electron m ean free path approaching a lower lim it with the consequent breakdown ofthe classicalBoltzm ann theory. W e have estim ated the e-ph coupling param eter tr from the linear dependence of to be approxim ately 0.24 and 1.3, respectively for nonsuperconducting and superconducting sam ples. The sm all value of tr for the form er is consistent with band structure calculations,while for the latter,it is 5-6 tim es larger than the theoretical value. The present resistivity results along with the structure,value and tem perature dependence ofthe gap-param eter 2=kTc,and other im portantparam etersrelated to superconductivity suggestthatFe-based oxypnictidesare a class ofBCS superconductors with strong e-ph coupling sim ilar to Chevrelphases and A 15 com pounds.\n\n## A C K N O W LE D G M E N T S\n\n10\n\nThe authorswould like to thank B.G hosh and A .N .D asstim ulating and A .Palforthe technicalhelp during the sam ple preparation and m easurem ents.\n\n- [1] Y .K am ihara,T .W atanabe,M .H irano,and H .H osono,J.A m .C hem .Soc.130,3296 (2008).\n- [2] H .Takahashi,K .Igawa,K .A rii,Y .K am ihara,M .H irano,and H .H osono,N ature (London) 453,376 (2008).\n- [3] X .H .C hen,T .W u,G .W u,R .H .Liu,H .C hen,and D .F.Fang,N ature (London)453,761 (2008).\n- [4] G .F.C hen,Z.Li,D .W u,G .Li,W .Z.H u,J.D ong,P.Zheng,J.L.Luo,and N .L.W ang, Phys.R ev.Lett.100,247002 (2008).\n- [5] Z.A .R en,J.Yang,W .Lu,W .Y i,G .C .C he,X .L.D ong,L.L.Sun,and Z.X .Zhao,M aterials R esearch Innovations,12,1,(2008).\n- [6] Z.A .R en,J.Yang,W .Lu,W .Y i,X .L.Shen,Z.C .Li,G .C .C he,X .L.D ong,L.L.Sun,F.

The linear T dependence of ρ above 170 K followed by a saturation-like behavior at higher temperature is a clear signature of strong electron-phonon coupling. From the analysis of the T dependence of ρ, we have estimated several normal-state parameters that are useful for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. Our results suggest that Fe-based oxypnictides are phonon-mediated BCS superconductors like Chevrel phases and A15 compounds.",
