Compressed hydride superconductors are leaders in the race for a material that can conduct electricity without resistance at high or even room temperature. In the present work, we have discovered new lanthanum superhydride, cubic A15-type La4H23, with lower stabilization pressure compared to the reported *fcc*-LaH10. Superconducting La4H<sup>23</sup> was obtained by laser heating of LaH<sup>3</sup> with ammonia borane at about 120 GPa. Transport measurements reveal the maximum critical temperature *T*<sup>c</sup> (onset) = 105 K and the critical field *μ0H*C2(0) ≈ 32 T at 118 GPa, as evidenced by the sharp drop of electrical resistance and the displacement of superconducting transitions in magnetic fields. Moreover, we provide evidence for unconventional transport associated with a pseudogap phase in La4H<sup>23</sup> using pulsed magnetic fields up to 68 T. A large negative magnetoresistance in the nonsuperconducting state below 40 K, quasi *T*-linear electrical resistance, and a sign-change of its temperature dependence mark the emergence of pseudogap in this hydride. Discovered lanthanum hydride is a new member of the A15 family of superconductors with *T*<sup>C</sup> exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nThe search for high-temperature superconductors has been an important goal pursued tirelessly by researchers since the discovery of the superconductivity in mercury [1]. However, until 2014, the critical temperature (*T*c) of conventional superconductors had never exceeded the McMillan limit (~ 40 K) [2]. As one of the most effective methods of changing the structure of matter, pressure can lead to appearance of unusual properties of materials that are unlikely to occur in ambient conditions, such as conventional high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). The increase of *T*<sup>c</sup> in Hg-containing cuprates to 164 K under high pressure motivated extensive further research in this field [3]. On the basis of the chemical pre-compression idea, first proposed by Ashcroft [4], the breakthrough discovery of conventional HTSC in compressed sulfur hydride H3S with *T*<sup>c</sup> above 200 K at 150 GPa was made both theoretically and experimentally in 2014-2015 [5, 6]. Soon after, the HTSC record was broken by lanthanum superhydride LaH<sup>10</sup> with *T*<sup>c</sup> = 250 K at 170 GPa [7, 8]. The successful use of high pressure in the search for new superconductors provided a clear path to even room-temperature superconductivity and attracted considerable scientific interest. Over the past five years, such remarkable superconductors as YH<sup>6</sup> [9], YH<sup>9</sup> [10], CeH<sup>10</sup> [11] and CaH<sup>6</sup> [12] have been found.\n\nTo date, LaH<sup>10</sup> has the highest *T*<sup>c</sup> among binary hydrides, and the La-H system is one of the best studied both experimentally and theoretically [13-21]. Recently, a series of novel lanthanum hydrides was found using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis including traces of *Pm n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> [18] which belongs to the so-called A15 class of superconductors. However, due to the complex composition of the mixture and the low content of this phase, the transport properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> have not been studied. A15 (β-W) structural type is a series of intermetallic compounds with outstanding low-temperature superconducting properties and *Pm n* space group. Examples are vanadium silicide V3Si (*T*<sup>c</sup> = 17 K), Nb3Ge (*T*<sup>c</sup> = 23 K) and Nb3Sn (*T*<sup>c</sup> = 18.3 K).\n\nIn this work, we successfully synthesized a new representative of this class, cubic La4H<sup>23</sup> with A15 structure which stable in the pressure range of 91–120 GPa, using laser heating of LaH3-x with ammonia borane (NH3BH3) above 1500 K. Transport measurements showed a sharp drop of the sample electrical resistance in 10<sup>3</sup> times with the highest onset *T*<sup>c</sup> = 105 K, and the decrease of the critical temperature under external magnetic fields. Theoretical calculations support conclusions of the experiment and point to a strong electronphonon interaction in the hydrogen sublattice of *Pm n*-La4H23. In addition, we performed a comprehensive study of the magnetic phase diagram and magnetoresistance (MR) of A15 La4H<sup>23</sup> in pulsed magnetic field up to 68 T. Our observations reveal the unconventional nature of the non-superconducting state in this lanthanum hydride.\n\n## **Experimental details**\n\nIn this work, we used powder LaH3-x (x ≈ 0.1–0.2) with metallic conductivity, which was preliminarily synthesized from La powder and hydrogen under pressure, and ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) as the hydrogen source and pressure transmitting medium, considering the high-temperature decomposition reaction: NH3BH3→3H<sup>2</sup> + *c*-BN [11]. All the crystal structures were determined by in situ powder high-pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the SPring-8 (Japan) synchrotron radiation source, beamline BL10XU, using the wavelength of 0.4124 Å. The CeO<sup>2</sup> was used as a calibrant. Dioptas software was used to analyze the experimental XRD patterns [22].\n\nDiamond anvil cells (DACs) are essential for high-pressure experiments, and we used the DACs made of NiCrAl (40HNU) alloy. Diamond anvils had a culet of 60 μm, beveled at 8° to a diameter of 250 μm. For transport measurements, the MgO/epoxy was selected as insulting layer placed between the tungsten gasket and platinum foil leads. Molybdenum electrodes were sputtered on the surface of diamond anvils to connect the sample and Pt leads. The pressure was determined by the diamond Raman shift [23]. Further experimental details described in the Supporting Information.\n\nMagnetoresistance measurements in pulsed magnetic fields were carried out in a 24 mm bore of 72 T resistive pulse magnet (pulse time of 150 ms) at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HLD HZDR). Strands of the Litz wire glued to the silver paint were moved closer together to minimize open loop pickup. All twisted pairs were fixed using the GE7031 varnish. A bath helium cryostat was used, which made it possible excellent control of the DAC temperature between 4.5 K and 78 K. A 100 cm long NiCr wire with a resistance of about 150 Ohms wrapped around the diamond chamber was used as a heater. Cernox thermometers were attached to the DAC's body (60 mm long and 12 mm in diameter) for measurements of the temperature. A high-frequency (33.33 and 16.666 kHz) lock-in amplifier technique was employed to measure the sample resistance. For the measurements in high magnetic fields, we used a four-probe AC method with the excitation current of 1-2 mA (10 mA already significantly suppresses superconductivity in La4H23). The voltage drop across the sample was amplified by an instrumentation amplifier and detected by a lock-in amplifier. In general, we used the same methodology as in the previous studies of (La, Nd)H<sup>10</sup> [24], SnH<sup>4</sup> [25], and CeH9-10 [26].\n\n## **Computational details**\n\nThe evolutionary algorithm USPEX [27-29] was used to predict thermodynamically stable La-H phases. To investigate the La–H system, we performed both fixed- and variable-composition searches at 100, 120, 150 and 200 GPa. The number of generations was 100. We calculated the convex hulls in the temperature range from 0 K to 2000 K, using free energies computed by Phonopy [30]. Metastable structures with the energy ≤ 30 meV/atom above the hull are also presented on the convex hulls.\n\nStructure relaxations and energy calculations were performed using the VASP code[31-33] within density functional theory (DFT)[34, 35], implementing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange– correlation functional[36] and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method[37, 38]. The kinetic energy cutoff was set at 600 eV. Γ-centered k-point meshes with a resolution of 2π×0.05 Å-1 were used for sampling the Brillouin zone. The phonon band structure and density of states were computed using Phonopy [30] package implementing the finite displacement method, 2 × 2 × 2 supercells were generated. The energy cutoff and kspacing parameters for the VASP calculations were set at 500 eV and 2π×0.1 Å-1 , respectively. Sumo package [39] was used to visualize the phonon density of states and band structure. The k-points for phonon band structures were chosen using Hinuma's recommendation [40]. The Phonopy package was also used to calculate zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections and thermal properties, such as entropy and free energy. To calculate phonon frequencies and electron–phonon coupling (EPC) coefficients, we used Quantum Espresso (QE) package [41] utilizing density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [42], plane-wave PZ HGH pseudopotentials and the tetrahedron method [43, 44]. In general, we used the same methodology as in the study of La-Mg-H system [45].\n\n## **Results and discussion**\n\n#### *Superconducting properties of La4H<sup>23</sup>*\n\nThe scheme of the electrical DAC H1 prepared for the transport measurements is shown in Figures 1b, c. Laser heating of the LaH3/AB sample to temperature above 1500 K was performed at 123 GPa, then the pressure reduced to 120 GPa. Cryogenic measurements of the sample immediately showed the appearance of a drop in electrical resistance from 0.12 Ω to 10-4 Ω at 93 K (onset) corresponding to the manifestation of superconductivity in the sample (Figure 1a). After the second laser heating, a sharp superconducting transition was observed at 90 K at 114 GPa. The third laser heating led to an increase in pressure to 118 GPa and the critical temperature *T*<sup>c</sup> also rose to 105 K. This value is very close to the critical temperatures of cerium superhydrides CeH<sup>9</sup> and CeH<sup>10</sup> in the same pressure range [11], but the advantage of the studied La4H<sup>23</sup> is the much smaller amount of hydrogen (< 6 atoms per La) required to obtain this result. To further investigate the dependence of *T*<sup>c</sup> on pressure, we decompressed the DAC to 91 GPa (Figure 1a). We found that *T*<sup>c</sup> *(P)* decreases monotonically during the decompression runs reaching the maximum of 105 K at 118 GPa (Figure 1c).\n\nRemarkably, a change in the sign of the quasi-linear temperature dependence of the electrical resistance (*dR/dT*) is observed during decompression (Figure 1a) of the DAC H1. This phenomenon was previously observed during decompression in sulfur hydrides H2S and H3S [6], in phosphorus hydride PH<sup>3</sup> [46], in CeH<sup>10</sup> [26] and in ternary superhydride (La,Ce)H<sup>9</sup> [47]. As we have shown earlier for SnH<sup>4</sup> [48], the change in the sign of *dR/dT* is incompatible with the view of La4H<sup>23</sup> as a normal Fermi-liquid metal whose resistance is due to the scattering of electrons on phonons. Indeed, the influence of electron-phonon interaction on the transport properties of metals can be described using the Eliashberg transport spectral function α <sup>2</sup>*F*tr(ω), which, as a rule, differs little from the Eliashberg function for electron-phonon interaction α <sup>2</sup>*F*(ω) [49]. In the first approximation of the variational solution of the Boltzmann equations for electron transport [50], the dependence of electrical resistivity (*ρ*) on temperature (*T*) is linear\n\n$$\\rho(T) = T \\frac{\\pi V\\_{cell} k\\_B}{N\\_F \\langle \\upsilon\\_\\varkappa^2 \\rangle} \\int\\_0^\\infty \\frac{d\\omega}{\\omega} \\frac{\\varkappa^2}{s h^2(\\varkappa)} \\alpha^2 F\\_{tr}(\\omega),\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere *x* = ℏ/, Vcell – is the unit cell volume, *N*<sup>F</sup> – is the electron density of states at the Fermi level and the 〈 2 〉 – is the band-averaged Fermi speed of electrons. All of the above parameters are positive in all known three-dimensional materials, which leads to positive *dR/dT* for the vast majority of metals and alloys. Very rare exceptions are complex alloys with disorder effects at low temperatures, such as manganin and constantan[51-53]. At high temperatures the term 2 ℎ2() → 1, and we come to simple formula (2)\n\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\lambda\\_{tr} \\frac{\\pi V\\_{cell} k\\_B}{N\\_F \\langle v\\_\\chi^2 \\rangle} T,\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nwhere *λ*tr – is the transport electron-phonon coupling (EPC) parameter [49]. From this equation it is absolutely clear that if *dR/dT* < 0, then the transport EPC parameter must also be negative (λtr < 0), and the usual electron-phonon coupling strength (λ) will also be negative or about zero, which is incompatible with the concept of conventional superconductivity in La4H23. The negative sign of *dR/dT* and the narrowing of superconducting transitions in a magnetic field were independently confirmed by Cross et al.[54] and, therefore, are reproducible phenomena.\n\nInstead, the properties of polyhydrides in the non-superconducting state on the verge of their dynamic stability [55] should be described in the framework of a non-Fermi liquid model close to the models developed for describing the pseudogap phase and metal-to-insulator transitions in cuprates [56]. As we will see in the next paragraph, A15 La4H<sup>23</sup> exhibits the strong negative magnetoresistance characteristic of superconductors with a pseudogap phase. As can be seen from Figure 1с, a further decrease in pressure of DAC H1 leads to broadening of superconducting transitions up to complete disappearance of the superconducting state and decomposition of La4H<sup>23</sup> (Figures 1c, d).\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1.** Electrical DAC construction and transport properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> under pressure.

(d) Upper critical magnetic field *BС*2*(T)* of La4H<sup>23</sup> at 114 GPa obtained by extrapolation of the experimental data (steady fields) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL), [57] the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) [58, 59] and linear models. Inset: residual resistance of the sample after SC transition.\n\nTo further confirm the superconductivity, we measured the electrical resistance of the sample in DAC H1 in steady magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 8 T. Figure 1e shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistance of A15 La4H<sup>23</sup> in steady magnetic fields at 114 GPa. The sample demonstrates the absence (and even negative value) of broadening of superconducting transitions in a magnetic field, as previously observed for yttrium (YH6) [60] and lanthanum-yttrium ((La,Y)H10) hydrides [61]. *T*<sup>c</sup> shifts linearly to lower temperatures as the magnetic field increases from 0 to 8 T, as it should for superconductors. To estimate the upper critical magnetic field *μ0HC*2(0), we applied the GL model [57], and the WHH model [58], simplified by Baumgartner [59]. As Figure 1f shows, these two models yield the *μ0HC*2(0) as 24 T and 33 T, respectively. The coherence length can be estimated by μ0*HC*<sup>2</sup> =*Φ*0/(2π*ξ* 2 ) [62]. The *ξWHH*(0) and *ξGL*(0) are equal to 3.16 nm and 3.72 nm, respectively. These values are higher than the same parameters in *fcc* LaH<sup>10</sup> [62].\n\nInterestingly, the superconducting properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> are found to be more pronounced than those of the recently studied A15 Lu4H<sup>23</sup> (max *T*<sup>c</sup> = 71 K, [63]). This indicates that isostructural lutetium compounds, such as proposed LuH10, LuH9, and LuH6, will have lower critical temperatures than the corresponding lanthanum polyhydrides in contradiction with earlier theoretical predictions [64]. Moreover, due to the smaller atomic radius of Lu, we would have to apply much higher pressures to stabilize the corresponding lutetium hydrides (e.g., LuH10), making them less convenient to study than LaHx.\n\n#### *Pulsed magnetic field experiments and crystal structure of La4H<sup>23</sup>*\n\nUnusual transport properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> were the reason for further studies of this compound in DAC H2 at 121 GPa in stronger pulsed magnetic fields up to 68 T (Figure 2). Before the experiment, the DAC H2 was tested in steady fields up to 8T (Supporting Figure S8). The sample exhibited a superconducting transition at 84 K (onset), the extrapolated *μ*0*H*C2(0) is 32-45 T. Thus, the reproducibility of the synthesis results was demonstrated, although in this particular sample the derivative *dR/dT* was positive.\n\nPulse measurements allowed us to establish the presence of a region of pronounced negative magnetoresistance at temperatures below 40 K and at the field *H* > 25 T, and obtain inflection points where MR changes sign back to positive (Figure 2a, b). These points limit a separate region of the magnetic phase diagram (MR < 0, Figure 2b), which corresponds to the pseudogap phase of A15 La4H23. The amplitude of the jump in electrical resistance (Re Z) *R*max/*R*<sup>n</sup> = 1.55 at 4.5 K in the pseudogap region exceeds that in cerium superhydride CeH10, for which we previously found similar phenomena [26]. As in the case of cerium polyhydrides, a sign reversal of *dRmax/dT* is observed in the pseudogap region: *Rmax* reaches maximum of 0.185 Ω at 4.5 K and decreases along with temperature to *R*<sup>n</sup> = 0.115 Ω at 50.9 K. It is interesting to note that above the superconducting transition, at 102 K, the phenomenon of zero magnetoresistance is observed: MR ∝ *dR(H)/dH* = 0 (Supporting Figure S10).\n\nWe also were able to completely suppress superconductivity at *μ*0*H*C2(0) ≈ 32 T in the La4H<sup>23</sup> and complete the magnetic phase diagram for this compound (Figure 2b). In general, the behavior of *μ*0*H*C2*(T)*, is in satisfactory agreement with the WHH model traditionally used for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors.\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Transport properties in pulsed magnetic field and X-ray diffraction analysis of La4H23. (a) Dependence of the electrical resistance of the sample in DAC H2 on the external magnetic field *R(H)* measured in the AC mode at frequencies of 16.66 kHz (4.5 K) and 33.33 kHz (most cases). For ease of analysis, the original data were smoothed using a Fourier filter (Origin lab). Raw data can be found in the Supporting Information. Inset: photo of the DAC H2. (b) Magnetic phase diagram of La4H<sup>23</sup> at 121 GPa. \"SC\" marks superconducting region, the pseudogap phase (\"PG\") is marked by red and blue color where MR < 0, \"FL\" denotes the Fermi liquid metal behavior of the sample with MR > 0 and positive *dR/dT* > 0. (c) X-ray diffraction pattern and Le Bail refinement of the unit cell parameters of La4H<sup>23</sup> phase at 118 GPa. Experimental XRD data and the Le Bail fit are represented by red hollow circles and black lines, respectively. XRD pattern contains spurious signals from molybdenum (Mo) electrodes. (d) XRD patterns measured across the sample with a step of 5 μm. The sample is very homogeneous.\n\nFor the first time among polyhydrides, structural type A15 (*Pm*3̅ *n*) was found when studying the formation of europium hydrides [65] above 100 GPa. Then, polyhydrides with the same structure were found in Ba-H system [66], among lanthanum [18] and lutetium [63] polyhydrides and in the Y-H system[67], forming a fairly large family of superhydrides. As we found out in the previous section, A15 La4H<sup>23</sup> has the highest *T*<sup>c</sup> among all superconductors with A15 structure. Below we discuss the results of X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound.\n\nConsidering the large number of superconducting phases in the La-H system at megabar pressures, we combined the experimental powder XRD data and the computational crystal structure search [18]. The in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns, shown in Figure 2c, indicate that the lanthanum sublattice of DAC H1 sample possessing cubic *Pm*3̅*n* symmetry at 118 GPa. The volume of the unit cell is 28.9 Å<sup>3</sup> /La and the unit cell parameter a = 6.14 Å (Z = 8). This is in close agreement with the theoretical results in 118 GPa (≈ 28 Å 3 /La, see Supporting Figure S12). We also compared obtained unit cell volume of *Pm n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> with the reported one [18], which is 27.98 Å<sup>3</sup> /La at 150 GPa. This is slightly different due to higher pressure in the Laniel et al. experiment. The hydrogen content can be estimated by the difference between atomic volumes of La atoms and the hydrogen [68, 69]. According to Ref. [70] the volume of a hydrogen atom in pure compressed hydrogen at 118 GPa is 2.20 Å<sup>3</sup> /H, whereas La atom has a volume of 15.7 Å<sup>3</sup> /La[68]. Combining these data, we conclude that the La:H composition in our compound is close to 1:6.\n\nFigure 2d shows a series of XRD patterns measured at several positions across the sample in steps of 5 μm. All XRD images are almost identical at all locations containing the signals from the Mo electrodes and *Pm n*-La4H23. This confirms the uniform distribution of hydrogen and selective formation of only one phase in the process of synthesis. Computer modeling of this structure shows that in the hydrogen cage of La4H23, the shortest H-H distance is about 1.3 Å at 118 GPa, which is in the range of 1.0 – 1.5 Å, typical for hydride superconductors. This bond length is much longer than in pure H2: *d*HH ≈ 1.1 Å at 115 GPa [22].\n\n#### *Theoretical analysis*\n\nTo confirm the experimental observations and find the most probable hydrogen sublattice in the synthesized lanthanum hydride, we performed a series of thermodynamic calculations of the enthalpies of formation of various La polyhydrides at 100, 120, 150, and 200 GPa and temperatures from 0 to 2000 K, considering the zero-point energy (ZPE) contribution in the harmonic approximation. The corresponding convex hulls are shown in Supporting Figures S1-S6. As can be seen, *Pm n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> is close to the stability region and about 20-30 meV/atom above the convex hull at 100-150 GPa. This phase is dynamically stable at 120 GPa already in the harmonic approximation (Figure 3b), although further pressure reduction to 100 GPa destabilizes it in agreement with the experiment (Figure 1a). Increasing the temperature has a little effect on its relative stability (Supporting Figures S4-S6), whereas the stability of the neighboring highly symmetric phases *Im m*-LaH<sup>6</sup> and *Fm m*-LaH<sup>10</sup> is strongly affected. We found that *Im m*-LaH<sup>6</sup> is dynamically unstable in the harmonic approximation at 100-120 GPa and can undergo a distortion *Im m* → *Cmme* → *C*2/*m* at low pressure, which stabilizes La4H23. This is also supported by the known experimental fact of distortion of *Fm m*-LaH<sup>10</sup> at pressures below 140 GPa [17]. Thus, the convex hull deformation at low pressures, caused by a much faster destabilization of the *Im m-*LaH6, may lead to the possibility of experimental observation of *Pm n*-La4H23. Indeed, all lanthanum hydrides discussed above were synthesized in recent experiments [18].\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3.** Results of theoretical calculations of electronic, phonon and superconducting properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> at 100, 120 and 150 GPa. (a, c) Eliashberg functions of La4H<sup>23</sup> calculated without considering symmetry at 150 and 100 GPa, respectively. We used a k-mesh of 8×8×8 and a q-mesh of 2×2×2. The results were also verified on k-mesh 12×12×12 and q-mesh 3×3×3. Pictures were prepared using python script available on GitHub [71]. (b) Phonon band structure and density of states of La4H<sup>23</sup> at 120 GPa calculated in the harmonic approximation. The compound was found to be dynamically stable at this pressure. (d) Electron band structure and density of states projected on H and La atoms at 120 GPa. The contribution of hydrogen is ≈ 30 % of the total density of states.\n\nSuperconducting properties of *Pm n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> have been investigated theoretically using the normconserving Goedecker-Hartwigsen-Hutter (HGH) pseudopotential with the Perdew-Zunger (LDA) functional and *k, q*-grids of low density. These pseudopotentials give results that are in close agreement with the experimental data, so it is this computational approach that we will discuss below (Table 1 and Figure 3 a, c). We found that La4H<sup>23</sup> exhibits moderate superconducting properties at 100 GPa, and the electron-phonon interaction strength reaches λ ≈ 1.5. Critical temperature of superconductivity decreases with increasing pressure due to a decrease in the λ. The calculated *T*<sup>c</sup> of La4H<sup>23</sup> reaches 92-95 K at 100 GPa in the harmonic approximation in agreement with the experiment. The relatively low *T*<sup>c</sup> of this superhydride correlates with the low contribution of the hydrogen sublattice to the density of electronic states (Figure 3d), which is equal to about 30% of the total density of electronic states at the Fermi level (*N*<sup>F</sup> = 0.79 states/eV/La). The expected [72] upper critical magnetic field μ0*HC*2(0) = 29-51 T is also in reasonable agreement with the experiment (Figure 2b).\n\n**Table 1.** Parameters of the superconducting state of *Pm n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> calculated at 100 and 150 GPa in the harmonic approximation using HGH PZ pseudopotentials. \"McM\" stands for the McMillan formula [2], \"A-D\" stands for the Allen-Dynes model [73], and \"E\" corresponds to the solution of the isotropic Eliashberg equations [74] (μ\\* = 0.1 in all cases).\n\n| Pressure                | 100 GPa | 150 GPa |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|\n| λ                       | 1.49    | 1.0     |\n| ωlog, K                 | 650     | 892     |\n| ω2, K                   | 1121    | 1383    |\n| Tc<br>(McM)             | 73.5    | 61.4    |\n| Tc<br>(A-D)             | 91.7    | 68.0    |\n| Tc<br>(E)               | 94.7    | 70.4    |\n| NF, states/spin/Ry/Å3   | 0.196   | 0.182   |\n| 2Δ/kBTc                 | 4.69    | 4.04    |\n| Expected<br>μ0HC2(0), T | 51      | 29      |\n| 2Δ, meV                 | 19.1    | 12.2    |\n\nThus, as can be clearly seen, theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with experimental data for La4H23. However, this situation should be considered as unique! To demonstrate it, we carried out a primary analysis of the superconducting properties of two other polyhydrides of the A15 family: Lu4H<sup>23</sup> and Y4H23. Calculations at 200 GPa for A15 Lu4H23 give *T*<sup>c</sup> (A-D) = 187 K, λ = 2.32 and ωlog = 867 K (Supporting Figure S14). This *T*<sup>c</sup> is almost 3 times greater than the experimental result *T*<sup>c</sup> (exp) = 70 K[63], which we independently verified and confirmed[72].\n\nTo date, there are several publications that are in qualitative agreement with the results of our calculations for Lu4H23. First of all, it's prediction of the room-temperature superconductivity in LuH<sup>6</sup> [64] at 100 GPa. Considering the similar hydrogen content in Lu4H<sup>23</sup> and LuH6, as well as the high symmetry of these hydrides, it is not difficult to guess that in the experiment LuH<sup>6</sup> will have a much lower *T*<sup>c</sup> than predicted by theory. Secondly, one cannot fail to mention predictions of the room-temperature superconductivity in the Lu-Y-H system at a pressure of 100-200 GPa [75]. In both of these cases, we are dealing with a clear deviation of theoretical predictions from the experiment, due to strong correlation effects in *f*-shell of Lu, the inclusion of which has an extremely strong effect on superconductivity, but cannot be carried out within the framework of DFT.\n\nA very similar situation is observed for *Pm n*-Y4H<sup>23</sup> at 150 GPa: calculations with different *q*-point mesheslead to the fact that *T*c(Y4H23) must exceed 250 К (Supporting Figures S15-S16). This is hard to believe, given that previously studied *Im m*-YH<sup>6</sup> also demonstrated an abnormally low critical temperature: being a predicted room-temperature superconductor with *T*<sup>c</sup> > 270 K [76], it exhibits superconductivity only below 224 K [9]. Thus, here we encounter the problem of discrepancy between DFT calculations and experimental results that currently has no solution and should be addressed to future research.\n#### **Conclusions**\n\nWe have synthesized novel lanthanum superhydride La4H<sup>23</sup> with the A15 structure via laser heating of LaH<sup>3</sup> and NH3BH<sup>3</sup> at 118-123 GPa. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed a *Pm*3̅*n*-La4H<sup>23</sup> phase as the main reaction product, which has a clathrate hydrogen sublattice. Transport measurements confirm pronounced superconducting properties of La4H<sup>23</sup> with a maximum transition temperature of 105 K at 118 GPa in agreement with theoretical calculations. The calculated electron-phonon interaction strength λ is around 1.5. During decompression, *T*<sup>c</sup> of La4H<sup>23</sup> decreases along with the pressure below 118 GPa, and at 91 GPa the superconducting transition completely disappears. In the non-superconducting state between 98 and 120 GPa, La4H<sup>23</sup> demonstrates a change in the sign of the quasi-linear temperature dependence of the electrical resistance corresponding to the non-Fermi liquid (strange metal) behavior.\n\nExperimental magnetic phase diagrams down to 4.5 K was constructed and the upper critical field of La4H<sup>23</sup> *μ0HC2(0)* = 32 T were established. The experimental behavior of *μ0HC2(T)* in this compound, in general, can be described in terms of the WHH model. Discovered La4H<sup>23</sup> exhibits pronounced properties of a strange metal below *T*c: large *H*-linear negative magnetoresistance, the reversal of the sign of temperature coefficient of electrical resistance (*dR/dT*) below 40 K, and quasi-linear *R(T)* in non-superconducting state, which corresponds to the properties of the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors. The experiment shows that the physics of high-*T*<sup>C</sup> superhydrides is rather close to this of cuprates.\n\n# **Author statement**\n\n**Jianning Guo**: Validation, formal analysis, investigation, visualization, writing of original draft. **Grigoriy Shutov**: Validation, theoretical analysis, investigation, visualization. **Di Zhou**: Investigation. **Su Chen**: Investigation. **Yulong Wang**: Investigation. **Toni Helm**: Investigation. **Sven Luther**: Investigation. **Dmitrii Semenok**: Investigation, writing of original draft, theoretical calculations, review & editing. **Xiaoli Huang**: Investigation, writing, review & editing, funding acquisition. **Tian Cui**: Writing and review & editing, funding acquisition.\n\n#### **Declaration of competing interest**\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n# **Data availability**\n\nThe authors declare that the main data supporting the findings of this study are contained within the paper and its associated Supporting Information.

Electron, phonon, elastic and superconducting properties of La4H23**\n\n![](1__page_22_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S7.** Experimental transport properties of La4H23 in DAC H1. (a) Decompression of the DAC H1 and temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of the sample in real scale. Pronounced increase in electrical resistance in 10-100 times at *T* > *T*<sup>C</sup> is observed during decompression due to the beginning of the metal-insulator transition. The anomaly at 114 GPa is an exception. (b) Residual resistance of the sample detected in the SC state in magnetic fields of 0-4 T.\n\n![](1__page_22_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S8.** Experimental transport properties of La4H23 in DAC H2 before the pulsed field study. (a) Temperature dependence of electrical resistance of La4H23 at 121 GPa measured in magnetic fields 0-8 T in warming cycles. (b) Upper critical magnetic field *μ0HC2(T)* dependence on temperature reconstructed using onset *T*<sup>C</sup> and *T*<sup>C</sup> found via R50% criteria. Extrapolations based on the WHH model[1] are shown by red and green dashed lines.\n\n![](1__page_23_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S9.** Quasi *T*-linear dependence of the voltage drop across the DAC H2 sample during 4-contact measurements in AC mode on temperature in the range from 100 K to 260 K. In fact, this *R(T)* curve cannot be explained within the framework of the electron-phonon scattering model (e.g., Bloch-Grüneisen formula) and indicates the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the sample.\n\n![](1__page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S10.** Dependence of the electrical resistance of the sample in DAC H2 on the external magnetic field *R(H)* measured in the AC mode at frequencies of 16.66 kHz (4.5 K) and 33.33 kHz (most cases). Raw data. Such loud periodic noise is caused by large open loops in the contact wires of the DAC H2. (a) Magnetic field sweeps up and down together; (b) only sweeps down are shown and used to determine *μ0HC2(T)* according to *R50%* criteria.\n\n![](1__page_24_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S11**. Phonon band structure and corresponding density of states of La4H23 at 100 GPa in harmonic approximation. The compound has a small number of imaginary phonon modes, which are likely to disappear when anharmonic effects are considered.\n\n![](1__page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure S12**.

        "abstract": "Hydride superconductors continue to fascinate the communities of condensed matter physics and material scientists because they host the promising near room-temperature superconductivity. Current research has concentrated on the new hydride superconductors with the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). The multiple extreme conditions (high pressure/temperature and magnetic field) will introduce new insights into hydride superconductors. The study of transport properties under very high magnetic fields facilitates the understanding of superconductivity in conventional hydride superconductors. In the present work, we report experimental evidence of an unusual metal state in a newly synthesized cubic A15-type La4H23 that exhibits superconductivity with a Tc reaching 105 K at 118 GPa. A large negative magnetoresistance is observed in strong pulsed magnetic fields in the non-superconducting state of this compound below 40 K. Moreover, we construct the full magnetic phase diagram of La4H23 up to 68 T at high pressure. The present work reveals anomalous electronic structural properties of A15-La4H23 under high magnetic fields, and therefore has great importance with regard to advancing the understanding of quantum transport behaviors in hydride superconductors.",
