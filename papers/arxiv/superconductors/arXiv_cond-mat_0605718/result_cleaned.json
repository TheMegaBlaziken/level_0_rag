In this brief communication, we show that one of the keys to understand the superconductivity of N b3 Sn is the anisotropy in the electronic state, which is dem onstrated by the transform ation of FLL structure from hexagonal to squared with increasing ux density. Sim ilar observation in V3Sistrongly suggests that this is a comm on feature of the superconductors with A 15 structure, 9,10 w here the anisotropy of the Ferm i surface is re ected through the nonlocale ect.11/2 M eanw hile, the eld-induced enhancem ent of the m agnetic penetration depth at lower\n\nelds, which is absent in V3Si,13 indicates the presence of low energy quasiparticle excitation due to the quasiclassicalD oppler shift.14 This result strongly suggests that the superconducting order param eter also has an an isotropic (or multi-gapped) structure on the Ferm i surface.15\n\nN b3 Sn sam pleswere prepared by the m ethod described elsewhere.16 The superconducting transition tem perature was determ ined to be 17.9 (2) K , as inferred from the shielding e ect in m agnetization measurem ent. Several single crystals with a sizable dimension ( 10 m g each, covering a beam spot area of 7 m m2 w ith random crystal orientation) were used for SR m easurem ent with a high transverse eld spectrom eter (H iT ime) installed on the M 15 beam line of TR IU M F , C anada, w here they were irradiated by a m uon beam of 4 M eV . Further details on the SR measurem ents using H iT im e m ight be found in earlier publications.17 O ne of these crystals, which was con im ed to be of single dom ain at am bient tem perature, w as used for the neutron m easurem ents with the SAN S-J spectrom eter of JR R -3, Japan A tom ic E nergy A gency. In both measurem ents, precautions were taken to m inim ize the e ect of ux pinning: every time when external m agnetic eld was changed, the sam ple tem perature was raised above T c and cooled down again after the m agnetic eld was settled. The m agnetic eld dependence was obtained for transverse eld SR spectrum (TF - SR , where\n\nthe initialm uon spin polarization is perpendicular to the external eld) at 2.0 { 2.5 K and for SANS spectrum at 2.6 (1) K , respectively .\n\nSince we can reasonably assume that implanted muons (with 4 MeV) stop random ly on the length scale of FLL (which is 20{200 nm over the relevant eld range), TF- SR signal provides a random sam pling of the internal eld distribution B (r), P (t) = exp( { } { } } { } { } ( } } = x ( } dB ; , w ith n ( B ) = h (B B (r))i, where p is the additional relaxation due to random ux pinning, n (B ) is the spectral density for the internal eld de ned as a spatial average (hi) of the delta finction over a unit cell of FLL, is the muon gyrom agnetic ratio (= 2 = 135:53 M Hz/T), and is the initial phase of rotation.18 These equations indicate that the realam plitude of the Fourier transform ed m uon spin precession signal corresponds to the spectral density, n (B).

The m odel predicts an asym m etric eld pro le for n (B ) characterized by a negatively shifted sharp cusp due to the van H ove singularity associated with the saddle points of B (r) and an asym ptotic tail tow ards higher elds where the m axim al eld is determ ined by B (j = rj (with ri being the vortex centers) .\n\nExam ples of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of SR spectra at several external m agnetic elds are show n in Fig. 1, where one can readily observe the asym metric <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>lineshape w ith slight sm earing due to the random pinning of vortices, random local \f elds from nuclear m om ents, and the lim ited tim e w indow for FFT ( 4 s: note that such sm earing is irrelevant for the analysis in tim e dom ain).

For the reconstruction of B (r) from n(B ), one needsto know the two-dim ensionalstructure ofFLL obtained from other experim ental techniques including SA N S.In particular,it is noticeable in Fig.[1](#page-0-0) that the peak due to the saddle points exhibits a steep change w ith increasing external\f eld from 2 T to 3 T ,suggesting an anom aly in the FLL structure. A s show n below ,this speculation iscon\f rm ed by SA N S m easurem entsoverthe region ofrelevantm agnetic \f eld.\n\nIn a SA N S experim ent,a FLL gives rise to Bragg re- ectionsatreciprocallatticepoints,K = lu+ m v = Klm .

It is clear in Fig.[2](#page-1-0) that there is a di erence in the pattern of angles between data at 1{2 T and those at 3{4 T . Since the patterns at lower \f elds suggests an overlap oftwo (possibly distorted) hexagonaldom ains due to the tetragonalcrystal structure,theirchange into the nearly four-fold sym m etric pattern at higher \f elds dem onstrate the occurrence oftriangular-to-square lattice transform ation at 2{3 T .

T he sharp peaks are due to van H ove singularities arising from turning points in B (r), w herer<sup>~</sup> <sup>B</sup> (r)= <sup>0</sup>. A n additionalpeak (labeled by arrow )appears for the form er case because ofthe incom m ensurability between triangular FLL and squared shape ofB (r) around a vortex.

In particular,as show n in Fig.3,the spectralweightfor the lower \f eld side of the van H ove singularity strongly depends on the m agnitude ofd forthe squareFLL.Besidesthese, we need to introduce two m ore param eters to describe thereciprocalvectorsw hich undergo transform ation:the apex angle, ,and the m ean w idth for the FLL distortion, <sup>K</sup> , [22](#page-4-0) to describe the \nuctuation ofthe reciprocal vectors,K = l(1+ <sup>l</sup>)u + m (1+ <sup>m</sup> )v w ith a probability distribution function,P ( <sup>k</sup>)/ exp( <sup>2</sup> k=<sup>2</sup> <sup>K</sup> ) (k = l;m ).

T he anom alous enhancem entof observed in Fig[.4](#page-3-0)a isprobably dueto the artifact associated w ith this distortion;the reduced chisquareexceeds1.5 around 3 T w hileitistypically 1.2{1.4 for <sup>0</sup>H < 2 T or <sup>0</sup>H > 4 T (see Fig.[4f](#page-3-0)). Sim ilar scat<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>tering of the param eter value is also noticeable in v p and d over the relevant eld range, which m ay represent the system atic uncertainty due to the distortion. How ever, except for these anom alies, we can observe a clear trend in all of the param eters. N am ely, exhibits a gradual increase with increasing magnetic eld below 2 T (which wediscuss below in m ore detail), while y tends to decrease slightly at low er elds and levels o above 2 T The behavior of of the e ective vortex core radius, is commonly found in various superconductors, which is attributed to the stronger overlapping of supercurrents around vortex center and intervortex transfer of quasiparticles.23 The m agnitude of , at lower eld is in good agreem ent with the G inzburg-Landau coherence length, GL ' 39 A deduced from the relation H c2 = 0 =2 2 =2 ] [w ith H c2 (2 K ) being assum ed to be 22 T ]. A s is anticipated from the SAN S result, exhibits a steep change from 60 to 90 around 2{3 T . The behavior is qualitatively in good agreem ent with the prediction of the non-local model (solid curve11,12 , where the critical eld is assum ed to be 3 T ). Thus, it indicates that the anisotropic ow of the supercurrent due to the nonlocal e ect is the prim ary origin of the square-lattice form ation at higher elds. The m agnitude of d (\" 4 10 3), which should be regarded as a lower boundary considering the fact that it is reduced by an averaging over a varying symmetry axis,11 is considerably largerthan that observed in V3Si (\" 0:3{1 10 3 ),13 suggesting a stronger anisotropy in the Ferm i surface. The spin relaxation due to the random local distortion ( o) exhibits a gradual decrease with increasing eld : this is qualitatively understood as a result of stronger overlap of ux lines at higher eld that makes less room for ux lines to deviate aw ay from the regular position . Unfortunately, the SAN S data are available only up to 5 T due to experim ental conditions, and therefore the origin of the weak anom aly around 5.5 T (see Fig. 4c) is not identil ed at this stage.\n\nIt is Interesting to note that the anisotropy param eter d is sharply reduced to zero below 2 T : a sim ilar behavior is reported for V3Si.13 As shown in Fig. 4f, a com parative analysis w ith d xed to 0.004 ( an average for oH > 2 T) yields system atic increase of chi-squares, while little variation is found for other param eters. This is attributed to an additional cusp in n (B ) (see Fig. 3) corresponding to the saddle points relatively near the vortex cores where B (r) is in uenced by the squared shape of supercurrent ow . O ur result indicates that the eld pro le over the eld range of hexagonalFLL m ay be better described by the isotropic London m odel.\n\nNow , we discuss the origin of gradual increase of in Fig. 4a. O ur system atic study on the m agnetic eld dependence of in various superconductors indicates that the gradient (d =dH ) provides inform ation on the low energy quasiparticle excitations.15 In the m ixed state, the quasiparticle momentum ve is shifted by the ow of supercurrent v 。 around the vortices due to a sem i-classical D oppler shift, leading to a shift of the quasiparticle en-\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nFIG . 4: M agnetic eld dependence of various param eters to describe the eld distribution B (r) obtained by analyzing TF-SR spectra using the modi ed London model: (a) the e ective London penetration depth ( ), (b) the cuto param eter ( , ) , (c) the enhanced relaxation rate due to local disorder of FLL ( p), and the m ean width for the long-range distortion ( x ), (d) the apex angle of the mom bic unit cell in the real space (together with the SANS data), and (e) the dim ensionless param eters to describe an isotropy of supercurrent density around the ux lines Tkxyy, d).
