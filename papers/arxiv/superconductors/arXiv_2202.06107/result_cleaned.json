Gurevich<sup>1</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup>Department of Physics and Center for Accelerator Science,\n\nOld Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia 23528, USA\n\n<sup>2</sup>Department of Materials Science and Engineering,\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA\n\n<sup>3</sup> Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News, Virginia 23606, USA\n\n(Dated: February 15, 2022)\n\nWe investigated the nonlinear Meissner effect (NLME) in Nb3Sn thin film coplanar resonators by measuring the resonance frequency as a function of a parallel magnetic field at different temperatures. We used low rf power probing in films thinner than the London penetration depth λ(B) to significantly increase the field onset of vortex penetration and measure the NLME under equilibrium conditions. Contrary to the conventional quadratic increase of λ(B) with B expected in s-wave superconductors, we observed a nearly linear increase of the penetration depth with B. We concluded that this behavior of λ(B) is due to weak linked grain boundaries in our polycrystalline Nb3Sn films, which can mimic the NLME expected in a clean d-wave superconductor.\n\nThe Meissner effect is one of the fundamental manifestations of the macroscopic phase coherence of a superconducting state. Meissner screening current density J = −ensv<sup>s</sup> induced by a weak magnetic field is proportional to the velocity v<sup>s</sup> of the condensate. At higher fields, the superfluid density n<sup>s</sup> becomes dependent on v<sup>s</sup> due to pairbreaking effects, resulting in the nonlinear Meissner effect (NLME)[1–](#page-10-0)[8](#page-10-1). For a single band isotropic s-wave superconductor, the NLME is described by:\n\n$$\\mathbf{J} = -\\frac{\\phi\\_0 \\mathbf{Q}}{2\\pi\\mu\\_0\\lambda^2} (1 - \\Upsilon\\xi^2 Q^2),\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere λ is the London penetration depth, ξ is the coherence length, Q = mvs/~ = ∇χ + 2πA/φ0, m is the quasiparticle mass, χ is the phase of the order parameter Ψ = ∆e iχ, A is the vector potential, φ<sup>0</sup> is the magnetic flux quantum, and the factor Υ(T, li) depends on the temperature T, the mean free path l<sup>i</sup> and details of pairing mechanisms. Ginzburg and Landau (GL) were the first who obtained the field dependent-correction to the penetration depth λ(B) of the magnetic field B parallel to a semi-infinite superconductor[1](#page-10-0) :\n\n<span id=\"page-0-1\"></span>\n$$\n\\lambda(B) = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{\\kappa(\\kappa + 2^{3/2}) B^2}{8(\\kappa + 2^{1/2})^2 B\\_c^2} \\right] \\lambda,\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nwhere B<sup>c</sup> = φ0/2 <sup>3</sup>/<sup>2</sup>πλξ is the thermodynamic critical field and κ = λ/ξ is the GL parameter.\n\nIn recent years, the NLME has attracted much attention as a probe of unconventional pairing symmetries of moving condensates. Particularly, Yip and Sauls [2](#page-10-2)[,3](#page-10-3) showed that in a clean d-wave superconductor at kBT < p<sup>F</sup> v<sup>s</sup> the supercurrent acquires a nonlinear singular term ∝ |Q|Q strikingly different from that in Eq. [\\(1\\)](#page-0-0), where p<sup>F</sup> is the Fermi momentum. Yet Eq. [\\(1\\)](#page-0-0) can describe a variety of nonlinear electromagnetic responses, both in conventional and unconventional superconductors. For instance Eq. [\\(1\\)](#page-0-0) describes a clean d-wave superconductor at high temperatures T > p<sup>F</sup> vs/k<sup>B</sup> or a d-wave superconductor with impurities [2](#page-10-2)[–7](#page-10-4). In a clean s-wave superconductor, the NLME is absent at T T<sup>c</sup> as Υ ∝ exp(−∆/kBT) [9](#page-10-5) , but occurs in the dirty limit (ξ . l) in which Υ ∼ 1 even at T → 0 [10](#page-10-6). In multiband superconductors the NLME could probe the proliferation of interband phase textures [11](#page-10-7) or the line nodes and interband sign change in the order parameter or mixed s − d pairing symmetries in iron pnictides [12](#page-10-8) .\n\n<span id=\"page-0-0\"></span>So far the observations of the NLME in high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates have been inconclusive [13](#page-10-9)[–19](#page-10-10), mostly because of a small field region of the Meissner state in high-κ type-II superconductors and contributions of extrinsic materials factors, such as grain boundaries or local nonstoichiometry. Since the NLME becomes essential in fields B of the order of Bc, penetration of vortices above the lower critical field Bc<sup>1</sup> = (φ0/4πλ<sup>2</sup> )(ln κ + 0.5) B<sup>c</sup> [20](#page-10-11) limits the nonlinear correction in Eq. [\\(2\\)](#page-0-1) to (Bc1/Bc) <sup>2</sup>/8 ' ln κ/16κ <sup>2</sup> 1. Yet even small NLME terms in Eq. [\\(1\\)](#page-0-0) causes intermodulation effects[4,](#page-10-12)[5](#page-10-13) under strong ac fields, as it was observed in YBa2Cu3O7−<sup>x</sup> [17](#page-10-14)[,18](#page-10-15) .\n\nIn this paper we investigate the NLME in a thin film Nb3Sn coplanar resonator in a parallel dc magnetic field, which mitigates the problems of vortex penetration and nonequilibrium effects. We used the method of Ref. [22](#page-10-16) in which the resonant frequency ω = (LC) <sup>−</sup>1/<sup>2</sup> of a coplanar resonator is measured as a function of a parallel dc field B. Here C is the strip-to-ground capacitance and L = L<sup>g</sup> + L<sup>k</sup> is the total inductance containing both the geometrical inductance Lg, and the field-dependent kinetic inductance of the superconducting condensate, Lk(B) ∝ λ 2 (B) [21](#page-10-17). To extend the field region of the NLME, we performed our measurements on thin films of thickness d < λ for which Bc<sup>1</sup> = (2φ0/πd<sup>2</sup> ) ln(d/ξ) can be much higher than the bulk Bc<sup>1</sup> [23](#page-10-18). Rotating the field in the plane of the film gives rise to an orientational dependence of λ(B) [22](#page-10-16). Unlike the standard quadratic field correction to λ(B) observed on Nb [22](#page-10-16) and Al [24](#page-10-19) thin film resonators, we observed a nearly linear field dependence of λ(B) in polycrystalline Nb3Sn films. The fact that the NLME in the s-wave superconductor Nb3Sn exhibits the behavior expected from a\n\nclean d-wave superconductor[2,](#page-10-2)[3](#page-10-3) shows the importance of materials factors, particularly local nontoichiometry and weakly coupled grain boundaries characteristic of Nb3Sn, cuprates and pnictides [25,](#page-10-20)[26](#page-11-0) .\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the experimental setup and Nb3Sn coplanar resonator used in the measurements of NLME. Sec. III contains the main experimental results. Sec. IV summarizes the essential mechanisms of NLME and theoretical results necessary for the comparison of theory with experiment. Sec. V contains discussion of our results.\n\n## I. EXPERIMENTAL\n\n### A. Film Deposition and Patterning\n\nThe coplanar resonator was fabricated from a 50 nm thick Nb3Sn film on a 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm Al2O<sup>3</sup> substrate. The film was prepared with magnetron cosputtering using both Nb and Sn targets in a growth chamber at University of Wisconsin-Madision, as described in Refs. [27](#page-11-1) and [28.](#page-11-2) Figure [1](#page-1-0) shows the resistive transition in a film grown under a similar condition. The film had a midpoint T<sup>c</sup> ≈ 17.2 K, normal state sheet resistance of 5.1 Ω, and a residual resistance ratio (RRR), Rs(300 K)/Rs(18 K) ≈ 3.2.\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>FIG. 1. Temperature dependence of the resistance of the film Rs(T) with a midpoint critical temperature T<sup>c</sup> = 17.2 K.\n\nThe film has a polycrystalline structure with rigid grains along the [-1011] direction of the Al2O<sup>3</sup> substrate as revealed by the atomic force microscopy shown in Fig. [2.](#page-1-1) Those grains contributed to an RMS roughness of approximately 10 nm[27,](#page-11-1)[28](#page-11-2) .\n\nThe sample was patterned into a half-wave coplanar waveguide resonator using contact lithography followed by Ar ion milling. The optical image of the resonator is shown in Fig. [3.](#page-2-0) The meandered resonator has a total\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span>FIG. 2.

The center conductor has a width w = 15 µm, and a gap width s = 8.8 µm between the center strip and the ground plane. The s/w ratio was set to achieve a characteristic line impedance 50 Ω. The resonator is coupled to input and output RF probes by interdigital capacitors patterned on the strip. At the ends of the transmission line, landings pads for ground-signal-ground (GSG) probes were fabricated, shown as the lightly shaded region in Fig. [3\\(](#page-2-0)a). These were made by first removing few nanometers of oxide layers on the surface of Nb3Sn using Ar ion milling and then depositing a 20 nm thick layer of Pd in-situ using a lift-off technique. The landing pads made of Pd serve to prevent oxidation and damage of the film from repeated touchdown of the probes and ensure ohmic contact between the probe and the sample.\n\n### B. Measurement Setup\n\nThe patterned sample was mounted inside a cryogenic probe station equipped with a closed cycle cryocooler [29](#page-11-3) , as shown in Fig. [4.](#page-2-1) The complex transmission coefficient S21,<sup>12</sup> was measured as functions of temperature and the external in-plane magnetic field B. The resonant frequencies and the London penetration depth were extracted by fitting the dependence of the phase on frequency of the transmission spectra[30–](#page-11-4)[36](#page-11-5). The temperature of the sample was varied using a resistive heater underneath the sample stage, and a parallel dc field up to 200 mT was produced with a NbTi superconducting magnet. This magnet was mounted on a six-motor hexapod system that allowed for fine tuning of magnet orientation by ±7 ◦ in three axes while taking the sample measure-\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>FIG. 3. (a) The image of the Nb3Sn coplanar half-wave resonator with f<sup>0</sup> = 2.236 GHz. The meandered resonator in the center is terminated capacitively on both ends which tapers out to the input and output landing pads. (b) Zoomed in section of the coplanar resonator where the width of the strip is w = 15 µm and the gap between the signal strip and the ground is s = 8.8 µm.\n\nments. The temperature of the sample was measured using a calibrated Cernox (CX-1050-CU-HT, Lakeshore Cryotronics) resistance-temperature device fixed on the stage next to the sample. The output port of a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) provided rf power that was delivered to the resonator by landing two GSG probes to the contacts. These probes and the cables connecting to the network analyzer were calibrated using a Short-Open-Load-Through calibration substrate mounted on the sample stage at 7 K. The drive power of VNA was selected to be -30 dBm to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding distortion of the Lorentzian shape in transmission signal observed at higher power due to nonlinear heating effects [33,](#page-11-6)[37](#page-11-7) as shown in Fig. [5.](#page-2-2) To minimize the number of vortices trapped in the sample during its cooldown through Tc, we used three pairs of Helmholtz coils to reduce the ambient field Ba. The magnitude of B<sup>a</sup> was measured by a magnetometer while adjusting the coil currents to achieve B<sup>a</sup> <4 mG in an optimum configuration.\n\nThe resonance frequency f<sup>0</sup> = (CL) <sup>−</sup>1/<sup>2</sup>/2π is determined by the ground capacitance C and the resonator inductance L. Here L = L<sup>g</sup> + L<sup>k</sup> contains a geometrical inductance L<sup>g</sup> and a kinetic inductance Lk(T, B) associated with the inertia of supercurrents. The geometric inductance for the parameters of our sample L<sup>g</sup> = 420.5 nH/m was calculated in Appendix [A](#page-9-0) following Ref. [34.](#page-11-8) The kinetic inductance for a thin film strip of thickness d < λ(T) and width w is given by [21,](#page-10-17)[31,](#page-11-9)[32](#page-11-10)\n\n$$L\\_k \\approx \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\lambda(T)}{w} \\coth\\left[\\frac{d}{\\lambda(T)}\\right] \\approx \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\lambda^2(T)}{wd}.\\tag{3}$$\n\nTemperature dependencies of Lk(T) and λ(T) were inferred from the measured frequency shift δf /f<sup>0</sup> =\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 4.

By fitting the observed δf(T)/f0(7K) to Eqs. [\\(3\\)](#page-2-3) and [\\(4\\)](#page-2-4), we obtained λ(T) as described in the next subsection.\n\n<span id=\"page-2-3\"></span>For the NLME measurements, the alignment of the dc field B to the plane of the strip is crucial to keep the superconductor in the Meissner state and avoid perpendicular vortices penetrating from the film edges. These vortices caused by the misaligned field reduce the quality factor and give rise to an additional field dependence of δf(B, T) unrelated to the NLME. To find the orientation of the magnet which produces B parallel to the film plane and the minimum amount of trapped flux, the loaded quality factor QL(B) and δf(B) were measured as functions of the out-of-plane field angle ζ. We first measured the initial values of f0<sup>i</sup> and QLi at zero field, ramped the field up to 60 mT and down to zero, and measured the resulting values of f0<sup>a</sup> and QLa affected by the number of vortices trapped in the process. The sample was then thermal cycled above T<sup>c</sup> = 17.2 K at zero field to flush out trapped vortices. Measurements were repeated after the magnet was adjusted to a new angle. Shown in Fig. [6](#page-3-0) are the normalized shifts δf0/f<sup>0</sup> = (f0<sup>a</sup> − f0i)/f<sup>0</sup> and δQL/Q<sup>L</sup> = (QLa − QLi)/Q<sup>L</sup> as functions of the magnet angle ζ. Both δf0(ζ)/f<sup>0</sup> and δQL(ζ)/QL(0) peaked at ζ = 3.8 ◦ which we adopted as a magnet orientation producing the dc field parallel to the plane of the film. This procedure is similar to that which was used in Ref. [22.](#page-10-16)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>FIG. 6. Normalized shifts in (a) resonant frequencies and (b) loaded quality factors after cycling B from 0 to 60 mT and back to 0 as a function of the offset angle ζ. Both δf(ζ) and δQL(ζ) are peaked at ζ = 3.8 ◦ .\n\nHaving aligned the magnet, we measured f0(T, B) as a function of in-plane dc field up to 200 mT at parallel ϕ = 0◦ and perpendicular ϕ = 90◦ field orientations with respect to the strip indicated by Fig. [7](#page-3-1) at temperatures between 7 K and 12 K. After measurements at a given temperature were completed, the sample was warmed up above T<sup>c</sup> to expel any trapped vortices. For each field and temperature point, we repeated the measurement over 50 times, and the average f0(B, T) was calculated.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>FIG. 7. The coordinate system for the magnet orientation with respect to the direction of the rf current on the coplanar resonator.\n\n### C. Temperature Dependence\n\nThe temperature-dependence of λ(T) can be obtained from the measurements of the resonance frequency f0(T). Using Eqs. [\\(3\\)](#page-2-3) and [\\(4\\)](#page-2-4) we extracted λ(T) from the measured f0(T) by fitting the temperature dependence of a relative frequency shift δf /f<sup>0</sup> = [f0(T)−f0(7K)]/f0(7K) with the conventional two-fluid approximation of λ(T) = λ(0)[1 − (T /Tc) 4 ] −1/2 . Shown in Fig. [8](#page-4-0) is the temperature dependent part of f0(T) along with the fit with Eq. [4.](#page-2-4) The fit gives λ(0) = 353 nm, well above the London penetration depth λ(0) ≈ 90 nm for a clean stoichiometric Nb3Sn [35](#page-11-11). The latter may result from nonstoichimetric inclusions which cause a slight reduction of T<sup>c</sup> in our films[27](#page-11-1)[,28](#page-11-2). For λ(0) = 352 nm, w = 15 µm and d = 50 nm, the kinetic inductance L<sup>k</sup> = µ0λ 2 (T)/wd ' 200 nH/m at 9 K accounts for about 1/3 of the total inductance L = L<sup>g</sup> + L<sup>k</sup> with L<sup>g</sup> = 420.5 nH/m.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the large value of λ(0) is the grain boundary structure of our Nb3Sn films shown in Fig. [2.](#page-1-1) It has been well-established that Sn depletion at GBs [40](#page-11-12)[–43](#page-11-13) results in weak Josephson coupling of crystalline grains, which has been used to optimize pinning of vortices by GBs in Nb3Sn conductors[39](#page-11-14)[,44](#page-11-15). In turn, the weakly-coupled GBs facilitate preferential penetration of the magnetic field along the GB network causing an increase of the global λ, as is characteristic of many superconductors with short coherence length, including Nb3Sn, cuprates and pnictides [25](#page-10-20)[,26](#page-11-0) .\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG. 8. The normalized temperature-dependent part of the resonant frequency. The fit of the data to Eq. [4](#page-2-4) gives λ(0) = 353 nm.\n\n### D. Field Dependence\n\nShown in Fig. [9](#page-4-1) are the observed field dependencies of the frequency shifts for in-plane B parallel and perpendicular to the strip. In both cases δf(B) decreases nearly linearly with B above 30 − 40 mT but flattens at lower fields. Here the slope of δf(B) for in-plane B parallel to the strip is about twice of the slope of δf(B) for in-plane B perpendicular to the strip. In the field range 0 < B < 200 mT of our measurements the Nb3Sn film of thickness 50 nm is in the Meissner state as the parallel field B remains below the nominal lower critical field of a vortex in a thin film. Indeed, an estimate of Bc<sup>1</sup> = (2φ0/πd<sup>2</sup> ) ln(d/ξ) in the London approximation [23](#page-10-18) with d = 50 nm and ξ = 5 nm[38](#page-11-16)[,39](#page-11-14) yields Bc<sup>1</sup> ' 1.17 tesla exceeding B<sup>c</sup> = 0.54 tesla of Nb3Sn [38](#page-11-16)[,39](#page-11-14). The slope of δf(B) in Fig. [9](#page-4-1) increases with increasing temperature, consistent with the temperature dependence of λ(T).\n\nOur δf(B) data exhibit significant scatter, as has also been observed in NLME experiments on cuprate [15](#page-10-21). The error bars in Fig. [9](#page-4-1) represent a standard deviation from repeated measurements at each data points, δf(B) data for Bky having larger error bars as compared to Bkz. The main contribution to the error bars comes from vibrations of the sample stage and GSG probes originating from the cryocooler. For B perpendicular to the strip, longer probe arms had to be used in the NLME measurements, which increases the amplitude of vibrations.\n\n### II. CONTRIBUTIONS TO NLME\n\nIn this section we consider different contributions to the resonant frequency shift δf(T, B) caused by the inplane dc magnetic field B.\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>FIG. 9. Normalized frequency shift δf0(T, B)/f0(T, 0) as a function of the in-plane dc magnetic field (a) parallel and (b) perpendicular to the strip.\n\n### A. Meissner current pairbreaking\n\nWe start with the calculation of the contribution of pairbreaking Meissner currents to δf(H) using the TDGL equations for a dirty s-wave superconductor[45](#page-11-17)[,46](#page-11-18):\n\n$$\\tau\\_{GL}(1+4\\tau\\_E^2\\Delta^2)^{-1/2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+2ie\\Phi+2\\tau\\_E^2\\frac{\\partial\\Delta^2}{\\partial t}\\right)\\Psi$$\n\n$$=\\left(1-\\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\Delta\\_0^2}\\right)\\Psi+\\xi^2\\left(\\nabla-2ie\\mathbf{A}\\right)^2\\Psi,\\tag{5}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-4-3\"></span><span id=\"page-4-2\"></span>\n$$\\mathbf{J} = -\\frac{\\pi \\sigma\\_0}{4eT\\_c} \\Delta^2 \\mathbf{Q} - \\sigma\\_0 \\left(\\nabla \\Phi + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}\\right). \\tag{6}$$\n\nHere τGL = π~/8kB(T<sup>c</sup> − T), ξ = [π~D/8kB(T<sup>c</sup> − T)]<sup>1</sup>/<sup>2</sup> is the coherence length, D the electron diffusivity, Φ is a scalar potential, τ<sup>E</sup> is an energy relaxation time due to electron-phonon scattering[46](#page-11-18), ∆<sup>2</sup> <sup>0</sup> = 8π 2k 2 <sup>B</sup>Tc(T<sup>c</sup> − T)/7ζ(3), σ<sup>0</sup> = 2e <sup>2</sup>DN(0) is the normal state conductivity, N(0) is the density of states at the Fermi surface,\n\nand −e is the electron charge. Equations [\\(5\\)](#page-4-2) and [\\(6\\)](#page-4-3) were derived from the kinetic BCS theory assuming that Q(r, t) and ∆(r, t) vary slowly over ξ<sup>0</sup> ' (~D/kBTc) 1/2 , the diffusion length L<sup>E</sup> = (DτE) <sup>1</sup>/<sup>2</sup> and τ<sup>E</sup> [45](#page-11-17)[,46](#page-11-18), where\n\n$$\\tau\\_E = \\frac{8\\hbar}{7\\pi\\zeta(3)\\gamma k\\_B T\\_F} \\left(\\frac{c\\_s}{v\\_F}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T\\_F}{T}\\right)^3. \\tag{7}$$\n\nHere c<sup>s</sup> is the speed of longitudinal sound, v<sup>F</sup> and T<sup>F</sup> = <sup>F</sup> /k<sup>B</sup> are the Fermi velocity and temperature, respectively, and γ is a dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant.

The dependencies of λ<sup>ω</sup> and σ<sup>ω</sup> on the orientation of B persist as long as ωτ . 1 and disappear at ωτ 1. The latter occurs both at T → T<sup>c</sup> where τGL(T) diverges and at low temperatures where τE(T) ∝ T −3 increases strongly.\n\nWe estimate δλ(B) = λ(B) − λ = (πξdB/φ0) <sup>2</sup>/2 at ϕ = π/2 and ωτ 1 for d = 50 nm and ξ = 5 nm. Here δλ/λ = 7.7 × 10−<sup>4</sup> at B = 100 mT, which translates to δλ = 0.27 nm at λ = 350 nm. If the total L is dominated by the kinetic inductance, Eq.

[\\(2\\)](#page-0-0). For d = 50 nm ξ = 5 nm, ϕ = π/2 and B = 100 mT, we obtain δf(B)/f<sup>0</sup> = (πξdB/φ0) <sup>2</sup>/2 ' 8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>4</sup> , well below the observed δf /f0. Taking the geometrical inductance into account further reduces δf /f<sup>0</sup> by a factor ' 3. Moreover, according to Eq. [\\(21\\)](#page-5-1) the field-induced shift δλ at ϕ = π/2 for which the rf currents are parallel to the dc Meissner currents is 3 times larger than δλ at ϕ = 0. This is inconsistent with the experimental data shown in Fig. [9](#page-4-0) where the slope of δf(B)/f<sup>0</sup> at ϕ = 0 is about 2 times larger than for δf(B)/f<sup>0</sup> at ϕ = π/2. Thus, not only is the Meissner pairbreaking too weak to account for the observed δf /f<sup>0</sup> but it yields the field and orientational dependencies of δf(B)/f<sup>0</sup> inconsistent with our experimental data on Nb3Sn.\n\n## B. Grain boundary contribution\n\nA significant contribution to L<sup>k</sup> can come from local non-stoichiometry, strains, and grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline Nb3Sn. Particularly, the well-known Sn depletion at GBs [40–](#page-11-0)[43](#page-11-1) results in weak Josephson coupling of grains in Nb3Sn. Our polycrystalline films have lateral grain sizes l<sup>2</sup> ∼ 0.1 − 1 µm (see Fig. [2\\)](#page-1-0) and local nonstoichiometry causing inhomogeneities of superconducting properties on the same length scales [27,](#page-11-2)[28](#page-11-3). If weakly coupled GBs are regarded as planar Josephson junctions (JJs), each GB has a kinetic inductance [47](#page-11-4)\n\n$$L\\_J = \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{2\\pi I\\_c \\cos\\theta},\\tag{25}$$\n\nwhere Ic(T) is a critical current of the JJ. The field dependence of L<sup>J</sup> (B) is determined by the phase difference θ(r) induced by the dc field on a GB. Because GBs in Nb3Sn can have broad distributions of sizes and I<sup>c</sup> values [25](#page-10-0), low-I<sup>c</sup> GBs can significantly increase L<sup>J</sup> if they form interfaces blocking the cross-section of the film.\n\nAn array of weakly-coupled GBs can be modeled by a Hamiltonian of a granular superconductor [48–](#page-11-5)[50](#page-11-6)\n\n$$\\mathcal{H} = -\\sum\\_{ij} J\\_{ij}\\cos(\\chi\\_i - \\chi\\_j - A\\_{ij}),\\tag{26}$$\n\nwhere the coupling energies Jij = ~I ij <sup>c</sup> /2e of the i-th and j-th grains are proportional to the respective intergrain Josephson critical currents I ij c , χ<sup>i</sup> and χ<sup>j</sup> are phases of the superconducting order parameters in the grains, and the magnetic phase factors Aij are given by:\n\n$$A\\_{ij} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\phi\\_0} \\int\\_i^j \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}.\\tag{27}$$\n\nMonte-Carlo simulations of the Hamiltonian [\\(26\\)](#page-6-0) of a disordered XY model have shown that the helicity moduli and the global kinetic inductance change nearly linearly with the dc magnetic field at B . φ0/l<sup>2</sup> <sup>2</sup> and exhibit strong fluctuations as functions of B due to transitions between many metastable states in finite JJ arrays [49,](#page-11-7)[50](#page-11-6) . These results appear qualitatively consistent with the observed field dependence of δf(B)/f<sup>0</sup> shown in Fig. [9.](#page-4-0)\n\nTo get an insight into the nearly linear decrease of δf(B) with B shown in Fig. [9,](#page-4-0) we use a mean-field model in which cos(χ<sup>i</sup> − χ<sup>j</sup> − Aij ) is replaced with an averaged value hcos θi.

We consider here a simple case of randomly-oriented GBs with equal probabilities of all α<sup>i</sup> and β<sup>j</sup> . Then Eq. [\\(38\\)](#page-7-3) reduces to the integrals [\\(B12\\)](#page-10-1) and [\\(B13\\)](#page-10-2) given in Appendix [B.](#page-9-0) Numerical calculation of these integrals for hcos θi yields the field dependencies of hL<sup>J</sup> i shown in Fig. [11.](#page-7-4)\n\n![](0__page_7_Figure_14.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-7-6\"></span><span id=\"page-7-4\"></span>FIG. 11. The field-dependencies of the kinetic inductance hL<sup>J</sup> (B)i calculated from Eqs.

First, the GB contribution hL<sup>J</sup> (B)i is quadratic in B only at very low fields B . B<sup>0</sup> B<sup>c</sup> and exhibits a nearly linear field dependence at B & B<sup>0</sup> Bc, whereas the Meissner pairbreaking gives δL<sup>k</sup> ∝ B<sup>2</sup> all the way to B = Bc1. Second, the field Bkz applied along the strip causes stronger increase of hL<sup>J</sup> (B)i than the transverse field Bky. This is the opposite of the orientational field dependence of δL<sup>M</sup> k (B) described by Eq. [\\(23\\)](#page-5-0) and observed on Nb coplanar resonator [22](#page-10-3). Yet both features of hL<sup>J</sup> (B)i are in agreement with our experimental data on polycrystalline Nb3Sn shown in Fig. [9.](#page-4-0)\n\n## III. DISCUSSION\n\n<span id=\"page-7-3\"></span><span id=\"page-7-2\"></span><span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>To compare the contributions of Meissner pairbreaking and weakly-coupled GBs to δf(B)/f0, we evaluate the GB kinetic inductance L J k per unit length of the strip in the above mean-field model. If GBs have the same critical current density Jc, dimensions d×l<sup>2</sup> but different orientations, L J <sup>k</sup> ∼ hL<sup>J</sup> i/l2, where hL<sup>J</sup> i is given by Eq. [\\(25\\)](#page-6-5) with I<sup>c</sup> ∼ dwJc. As a result,\n\n<span id=\"page-7-5\"></span>\n$$L\\_k^J \\sim \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{2\\pi J\\_c w d l\\_2 \\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle} \\sim L\\_k^M \\times \\frac{\\xi J\\_d}{l\\_2 J\\_c} \\tag{39}$$\n\nHere J<sup>d</sup> = φ0/2πµ0λ 2 ξ is of the order of the GL depairing current density. The kinetic inductance is dominated by weakly-coupled GBs if J<sup>c</sup> ξJd/l2. For our Nb3Sn films with ξ ' 5 nm and l<sup>2</sup> ' 200 nm, the GB contribution dominates if J<sup>c</sup> . 10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup>Jd.\n\nThe effective penetration depth λ extracted from the measured kinetic inductance is affected by GBs. The\n\nMeissner contribution L<sup>M</sup> k is determined by the London penetration depth λ in the dirty limit[46](#page-11-10):\n\n$$L\\_k^M = \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\lambda^2}{dw} = \\frac{\\hbar \\rho\\_s}{\\pi dw \\Delta(T)} \\coth \\frac{\\Delta(T)}{2k\\_B T},\\qquad(40)$$\n\nwhere ρ<sup>s</sup> is the normal state resistivity. If GBs can be modeled as S-I-S Josephson junctions [47](#page-11-4), their contribution to L<sup>k</sup> can be evaluated from Eq. [\\(39\\)](#page-7-5):\n\n$$L\\_k^J \\sim \\frac{\\hbar}{eJ\\_c w dl\\_2} \\simeq \\frac{\\hbar R\\_\\perp}{dw l\\_2 \\Delta(T)} \\coth \\frac{\\Delta(T)}{2k\\_B T},\\qquad(41)$$\n\nwhere R<sup>⊥</sup> is the tunneling resistance of the JJ per unit area. Defining the effective penetration depth λ˜ in the total kinetic inductance L<sup>k</sup> = L<sup>M</sup> <sup>k</sup> + L J <sup>k</sup> <sup>=</sup> <sup>λ</sup>˜2/dw and combining Eqs. [\\(40\\)](#page-8-0) and [\\(41\\)](#page-8-1), we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\lambda}^2(T) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\pi \\Delta(T)} \\left[ \\rho\\_s + C\\_1 \\frac{R\\_\\perp}{l\\_2} \\right] \\coth \\frac{\\Delta(T)}{2k\\_B T}, \\qquad (42)\n$$\n\nwhere the factor C<sup>1</sup> ∼ 1 accounts for details of the shape and angular distributions of GBs. In the S-I-S model the temperature dependencies of the GB and Meissner contributions to λ˜ are the same. This is no longer the case if GBs are proximity-coupled S-N-S junctions [47](#page-11-4) for which J<sup>c</sup> ∝ (1 − T /Tc) 2 . The S-N-S scenario may be more relevant for Nb3Sn in which strongly-coupled GBs can transmit high current densities which are still well below the depairing limit [39–](#page-11-11)[44](#page-11-12) .\n\nThe above estimate pertains to B = 0 but the fieldinduced frequency shift δf /f<sup>0</sup> is determined by small field - dependent corrections δL<sup>M</sup> k and δL<sup>J</sup> k . Here δL<sup>M</sup> k is given by Eq. [\\(23\\)](#page-5-0) and δL<sup>J</sup> <sup>k</sup> ∼ (µ0λ <sup>2</sup>/dw)(ξJd/l2Jc)(B/B0) at B & B<sup>0</sup> ' φ0/3πdl2, as shown in Fig. [11.](#page-7-4) Hence,\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta L\\_k^M}{\\delta L\\_l^J} \\sim \\frac{B\\xi dJ\\_c}{\\phi\\_0 J\\_d}, \\qquad B \\gtrsim B\\_0 \\tag{43}$$\n\nThis ratio is independent of the lateral GB sizes and is much smaller than 1 since J<sup>c</sup> Jd, and Bdξ/φ<sup>0</sup> < 2 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at B < 200 mT, ξ = 5 nm and d = 50 nm. Thus, the NLME field-dependent frequency shift in our polycrystalline Nb3Sn coplanar resonators is dominated by grain boundaries, even if their contribution to the total kinetic inductance at B = 0 is much smaller than that of the Meissner currents. This conclusion is consistent not only with the observed nearly linear field dependence of δf /f<sup>0</sup> but also with the fact that the slope of δf /f<sup>0</sup> at B along the strip is larger than the slope of δf /f<sup>0</sup> at B perpendicular to the strip.\n\nThe fit of the observed δf(T, B)/f0(T, 0) to the GB model depends on many uncertain parameters such as distribution of orientations and local J<sup>c</sup> values of GBs, their geometrical sizes and mechanisms of current transport through GBs. Shown in Fig. [12](#page-8-2) is an example of δf(T, B)/f0(T, 0) calculated for uniform distributions of the Euler angles of GBs:\n\n<span id=\"page-8-3\"></span>\n$$\\frac{\\delta f(T, B)}{f\\_0(T, 0)} = \\left[ \\frac{1 + a\\epsilon(T) / \\langle \\cos \\theta(0) \\rangle}{1 + a\\epsilon(T) / \\langle \\cos \\theta(B) \\rangle} \\right]^{1/2} - 1,\\tag{44}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-8-1\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>where a = L J k (0, 0)/L, the factor (T) = [1 − (T /Tc) 4 ] −2 approximates the S-N-S temperature dependence of Jc(T) in Eq.

We took a = 3.5×10−<sup>4</sup> , B<sup>0</sup> = 10 mT and different temperatures corresponding to those in Fig. [9.](#page-4-0) As follows from Fig. [12,](#page-8-2) the model captures the observed features of δf(T, B)/f0(T, 0) for both orientations of B shown in Fig. [9,](#page-4-0) although one can hardly expect a perfect fit from such a crude model. For instance, the difference between the slopes of δf(T, B)/f0(T, 0) for two field orientations in Fig. [12](#page-8-2) is about 30% higher than in Fig. [9,](#page-4-0) which can occur because the GB orientations shown in Fig. [2](#page-1-0) are not completely random. Yet the GBs can dominate the fieldinduced frequency shift even if they only contribute less than 10−<sup>3</sup> to the total inductance of the strip.\n\n![](0__page_8_Figure_14.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-8-2\"></span>FIG. 12.

For proximity-coupled GBs, ω<sup>c</sup> can be smaller than ∆/~ even at T T<sup>c</sup> and B < B<sup>0</sup> since JcR for S-N-S JJs can be much smaller than ∆/e [47](#page-11-4) . For Nb3Sn in which ∆/~ ∼ 1 THz is some 2 orders of magnitude higher than the frequency 2πf<sup>0</sup> of our resonator, it appears that the observed behavior of δf(T, B) at 7 < T < 12 K is consistent with the low-frequency limit ω ωc(T, B) in which Eq. [\\(45\\)](#page-9-1) gives:\n\n$$R\\_J(B) \\sim \\frac{\\phi\\_0^2 \\omega^2}{4\\pi^2 R\\_\\square J\\_c^2 w d l\\_2 \\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle^2} \\tag{47}$$\n\nFor hL<sup>J</sup> (B)i calculated above (see Fig. [11\\)](#page-7-4), R<sup>J</sup> (B) ∝ B<sup>2</sup> in Eq. [\\(47\\)](#page-9-2) increases quadratically with B at B & B0. This field dependence is the same as for the Meissner contribution to σω(B) in Eq. [\\(22\\)](#page-5-2), but the orientational dependence of R<sup>J</sup> (B) is opposite to that of σω(B). Thus, GBs can give rise to a strong nonlinearity of the electromagnetic response of polycrystalline films, which can be essential for Nb3Sn thin film coatings of high-Q resonator cavities in particle accelerators [28](#page-11-3)[,42,](#page-11-13)[43,](#page-11-1)[53](#page-11-14) .\n\nIn conclusion, grain boundaries and local nonstoichiometry on nanometer scales can significantly contribute to the NLME in polycrystalline Nb3Sn. Particularly, GBs can cause the linear field-dependence of the magnetic penetration depth expected from a clean dwave superconductor at low temperatures. By contrast, for elemental superconductors such as Nb [22](#page-10-3) and Al [24](#page-10-4) with large coherence lengths, δλ(T, B) ∝ B<sup>2</sup> is described well by the Meissner pairbreaking. However, extended crystalline defects in superconductors with short coherence lengths can radically change the field-dependence of δλ(T, B), even if their contribution to the kinetic inductance at zero field is small. This feature can impose stringent requirements for the quality of single crystals used for the observation of manifestations of d-wave pairing in λ(T, B), particularly in cuprates and pnictides which are prone to the weak-link behavior of grain boundaries.\n\n## IV.

We used low rf power probing in films thinner than the London penetration depth λ (B ) to significantly increase the field onset of vortex penetration and measure the NLME under equilibrium conditions. Contrary to the conventional quadratic increase of λ (B ) with B expected in s -wave superconductors, we observed a nearly linear increase of the penetration depth with B . We concluded that this behavior of λ (B ) is due to weak linked grain boundaries in our polycrystalline Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn films, which can mimic the NLME expected in a clean d -wave superconductor.",
