      "caption": "The figure shows the behavior of the critical current density (Jc) as a function of reduced temperature (t) in the Disordered phase (dashed line) and Bragg Glass phase (solid line), using two pinning models. In panel (a), different critical current densities at zero temperature are used for the two phases, displaying the Peak Effect at the BrG/Disordered transition across all temperatures. Panel (b) depicts the scenario when both phases have the same zero-temperature critical current density, showing that at low temperatures, the transition does not manifest as a Peak Effect. This highlights that the phase transition can occur without the Peak Effect if the Jc values in both phases are similar【4:5†source】.",

Panel (a) shows harmonics for different zero-temperature critical current densities in the disordered and Bragg Glass phases, while panel (b) assumes the same critical current density for both. A dip in the first harmonic and dual peaks in the third harmonic correlate with the phase transition temperature Tp, indicating the Peak Effect at high temperatures【4:2†source】.",

Panel (a) uses different zero-temperature critical current densities, while panel (b) uses identical densities for both phases. The Peak Effect is visible in panel (a) but is diminished in panel (b), supporting the hypothesis that equal Jc values in the two phases suppress its manifestation. The third harmonic data verify the transition's presence by evidencing temperature Tp【4:0†source】.",

      "caption": "The figure depicts the real part of the 1st (panel a) and 3rd (panel b) harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for V3Si single crystals at various DC fields. In panel (a), a dip indicates the Peak Effect at 1 T to 7 T, but it vanishes at higher fields/lower temperatures. Panel (b) shows dual positive peaks in the third harmonic, indicating complex vortex behavior and phase transitions at varied DC fields. These measurements validate the theoretical prediction of phase transitions even without observable Peak Effects【4:6†source】【4:8†source】.",

This diagram identifies critical transitions at different field strengths and temperatures, confirming theoretical predictions.
