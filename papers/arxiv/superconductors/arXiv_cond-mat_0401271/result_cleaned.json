The experimental ndings described here con m a key prediction of recent m icroscopic theories describing interacting vortibes. The e ects of vortex-vortex interactions on the m agnetic and electronic structure of the vortex state are of crucial in portance to the interpretation of experim ents on both conventional and exotic superconductors in an applied m agnetic eld.\n\nPACS num bers: 74.20 Fg, 74.25.Qt, 74.70 Ad, 76.75 + i\n\nIn 1964, a breakthrough paper by Caroli, de G ennes and M atricon [1] showed that in the fram ew ork of the m icroscopic theory, quasiparticles (Q P s) bound to an isolated vortex of a conventional s-wave type-II superconductor occupy discrete energy levels. Twenty- ve years later, localized vortex core states were observed for the rst time in NbSe2 by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM ) [2]. Our understanding of the vortex state in type=II superconductors has accordingly progressed from A brikosov's initial prediction [3] based on the m acroscopic G inzburg-Landau (G L) theory [4], to current theories describing the electronic structure of m agnetic vortices on a m icroscopic level. How ever, it is only in recent years that predictions have em erged from the m icroscopic theory on the e ects of vortex-vortex interactions. In analogy with bringing atom s close together to form a conducting solid, increasing the vortex density by applying a stronger m agnetic eld H enhances the overlap of bound state wave functions of neighboring vortices, resulting in the form ation of energy bands that allow the intervortex transfer of Q P s [5, 6, 7, 8]. This is expected to strongly in uence experim ents on conventional superconductors that are sensitive to quasiparticle excitations, such as speci c heat and them al transport, and to have profound e ects on the m agnetic structure of the vortex state. How ever, understanding the potential interplay between vortices and quasiparticles is also of crucial im portance in the study of high-tem perature superconductors. In these and other exotic superconductors, com paratively little is known about the structure of the vortex state and its e ect on experim ents in large m agnetic elds. It is therefore essential to have a solid understanding of the behavior of interacting vortices in conventional superconductors, and to establish the connections with quasiparticle properties.\n\nThe e ect of delocalized QP core states on the spatial variation of the pair potential (r) at a vortex site\n\nhas been considered in the fram ework of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory [7, 8, 9]. These calculations show that the e ect of the intervortex transfer of Q P s on\n\n(r) leads to a reduction of the size of the vortex cores with increasing H . Such shrinking of the vortex cores has in fact been observed by muon spin rotation ( SR ) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and STM [17], and proposed as a possible explanation for the anom alous low - eld be havior observed of the speci c heat in conventional superconductors [18, 19]. How ever, experim entally there has been inadequate evidence in support of a causal relationship between the size of the vortex cores and the delocalization of bound Q P core states.\n\nAn important nding has come by way of recent low tem perature them al conductivity m easurem ents, which are sensitive only to extended or delocalized electronic excitations. These studies have revealed the existence of highly delocalized Q P s down to low m agnetic elds in the vortex state of LuN i2B2C [20], Y B a2C u30 6:9 [21], N bSe2 [22] and M gB2 [23]. In the extrem e gap anisotropy superconductors LuN 2B2C and YBa2Cu30 6:97 the dom inant contribution to the them al conductivity is believed to be a eld-induced D oppler shift of the Q P spectrum outside the vortex cores [24]. M ost surprising are the results for N bSe2, long believed to be representative of a sim ple conventionals-wave superconductor. The high degree of QP delocalization in NbSe2 appears to arise from twogap superconductivity [22], as is the case for M gB 2 [23]. In these superconductors, the heat at low elds is carried by the QP excitations associated with the sm aller of the two energy gaps. This sm aller gap is a possible source of the very large low - eld value of the core size observed in NbSe2 by SR [10] and in M gB 2 by STM [25]. On the other hand, the large core size observed at low elds in borocarbide [15, 16] and cuprate [11, 12, 13] superconductors is not com pletely understood.\n\nThe conventional superconductors V3Si and Nb pro-\n\nR.F.Kie 2,6, JH.Brewer26, K.F.

In contrast to the abovem entioned superconductors,therm alconductivity m easurem ents [\\[22,26](#page-4-0)] revealno appreciable delocalization ofQ P states at low H | as expected w hen the vortices are nearly isolated. V3Siis particularly suitable,since it has a sim ple cubic crystalstructure,a relatively high superconducting transition tem perature (T<sup>c</sup> = 17 K ) and a large upper critical\feld (H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> 185 kO e).

A t higher elds decreases, and continues to do so when the V L com pletes its transition to a square at 40 kO e.\n\nG ygiand Schluter [34] have show n that the pair potential (r), which in generalis a num erical function, varies on two length scales, 1 and 2 . The rst is de ned from the slope of (r) near the center of the vortex core\n\n$$\\mathbf{r}\\_1 = \\mathbf{r}\\_0 = \\lim\\_{\\mathbf{r} \\ni \\mathbf{r}\\_0} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}\\_0}{\\mathbf{r}\\_1} \\tag{2}$$\n\n( 0 is the BCS superconducting energy gap), whereas 2 is the length scale over w hich (r) rises to its asym ptotic\n\nvalue 0. It is im portant to note that while at low tem peratures 2 is close to the value of the coherence length derived from H c2 (i.e. 42 A ), 1 is considerably shorter [see Fig. 3 (b)]. Thus, we can understand the reduction of above 7.5 kO e as a rapid variation of (r) at the vortex center, and not an increase of H c2 . Theoretically, the rapid increase of (r) near r = 0 is accom panied by a sim ilar rise of the supercurrent density j(r) in the sam e region [7, 8, 34]. Consequently, we can de ne an e ective vortex-core size ro as the distance from the core centre (r= 0) to the location where j(r) reaches its m axim um value, measured along the line connecting nearestneighbor vortices. Solutions of the m icroscopic theory show that 1 and ro exhibit the sam equalitative behavior as functions of H and T . From previous SR studies of the K ram er P esch e ect, it is known that the tted value of in Eq. (1) and ro exhibit sim ilar behavior, and hence\n\nre ects a particular sensitivity to 1. The param eter ro can be obatined in a nearly m odel-independent way using the M axwell relation, j (r) = j = j = j = j = (r) j w here B (r) is obtained from tting the SR time spectrum . Because ro is not a t param eter, the details of the theoreticalm odel for B (r) are not very im portant in this procedure. W hat is essential is that the m odel for B (r) y ields excellent ts, as was the case using Eq. (1) .\n\nIn Fig. 3(a) we com pare the eld dependence of ro in V 3 Sito the electronic them al conductivity previously [22]. For the rst time we see the expected eld dependence of the core size in a single-gap conventional s-w ave superconductor. In contrast to NbSe2 [10] and M gB2 [25], the low - eld value of ro is consistent w ith the coherence length calculated from H c2 . At low elds, where only a m odest overlap of the Q P core states of neighboring vortices is expected, both m and e exhibit a weak dependence on H . The change in ro over this range of H is prim arily due to the superposition of the j(r) pro les of nearest-neighbor vortices. This is indicated by the green circles in Fig. 3. A bove 7.5 kO e the core size shrinks m ore rapidly than that expected from the superposition of j (r) pro les, and is accom panied by a simultaneous increase in the electronic them alconductivity. Together these observations signify a change in the slope of (r) at the vortex center, due to an increased overlap of the bound state wave finctions of adjacent vortices. A s show n in Fig. 3 (a), the transform ation to a square vortex lattice begins at the eld where the delocalization of Q P s becom es signi cant. In other words, it is the increased strength of the vortex-vortex interactions that drives the symm etry change of the lattice to re ect the fourfold symm etry of the individual vortices.\n\nThe experim ental results presented here for V 3 Si conrm one of the key predictions of theoretical works that advocate the importance of intervortex Q P transfer to the detailed structure of the VL. This im portant detail should be a consideration in the interpretation of any experiment on a type-II superconductor in an applied m agnetic eld.\n\nW e thank Tetsuo Fukase for providing us w ith the sam -\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFIG . 3: (a) The m agnetic eld dependence of the vortex core size ro measured by SR (blue circles) at T = 3:8 K , and the electronic them al conduct.ivity e=T (red squares) from Ref.

The effects of vortex-vortex interactions on the magnetic and electronic structure of the vortex state are of crucial importance to the interpretation of experiments on both conventional and exotic superconductors in an applied magnetic field.",
