As the pair potential grows through the superconducting transition, each degenerate Landau level in the normal state splits into quasiparticle bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone. This brings Landaulevel broadening, which in turn leads to the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state. We perform extensive numerical calculations for three-dimensional systems with various gap structures. It is thereby shown that (i) this Landau-level broadening is directly connected with the average gap at H = 0 along each Fermi-surface orbit perpendicular to the field H; (ii) the extra dHvA oscillation attenuation is caused by the broadening around each extremal orbit. These results imply that the dHvA experiment can be a unique probe to detect band- and/or angle-dependent gap amplitudes. We derive an analytic expression for the extra damping based on the second-order perturbation with respect to the pair potential for the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic potential. This formula reproduces all our numerical results excellently, and is used to estimate band-specific gap amplitudes from available data on NbSe2, Nb3Sn, and YNi2B2C. The obtained value for YNi2B2C is fairly different from the one through a specific-heat measurement, indicating presence of gap anisotropy in this material. C programs to solve the two-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are available at <http://phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/~kita/index-e.html>.\n\n#### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) experiment on normal metals has been a unique and powerful tool to probe their Fermi surfaces.[1,2](#page-14-0) The main purpose of this paper is to establish theoretically that it can even be used to detect detailed gap structures of type-II superconductors.\n\nBack in 1976, Graebner and Robbins discovered the dHvA oscillation in 2H-NbSe<sup>2</sup> persisting down through the superconducting upper critical field Hc2. [3](#page-14-0) It was after 15 years later when Onuki ¯ et al. first reconfirmed it.[4](#page-14-0) Since then, however, a considerable number of materials have been found to display the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state. They include: A15 superconductors V3Si[5,6](#page-14-0) Nb3Sn,[7](#page-14-0) a borocarbide superconductor YNi2B2C,[8,9](#page-14-0) heavy-fermion superconductors CeRu2, [10](#page-14-0) URu2Si2, [11](#page-14-0),[12](#page-14-0) UPd2Al3, [13](#page-14-0) CeCoIn5, [14](#page-14-0) and an organic superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2; [15](#page-14-0) see Refs. [16](#page-14-0) and [17](#page-14-0) for a recent review. Basic features of the oscillation are be summarized as follows: (i) the dHvA frequencies remain unchanged through the transition; (ii) the oscillation amplitude experience an extra attenuation; (iii) the cyclotron mass does not change except for strongly correlated heavy fermion systems.\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that the dHvA oscillation is observable even in superconductors without a welldefined Fermi surface. Many theories have been presented to explain the persistent oscillation and the extra damping,[18,19,20](#page-14-0),[21,22,23,24,25](#page-14-0),[26,27,28,29,30](#page-14-0) which may be classified into three categories.\n\nThe first approach applies a Bohr-Sommerfeld semiclassical quantization to either the Brandt-Pesch-Tewordt[31](#page-14-0) (BPT) Green's function near Hc2, [18](#page-14-0) the electron number N at H = 0,[19](#page-14-0) or Dyson's equation at H = 0,[20](#page-14-0) for obtaining the oscillatory behavior of the magnetization. As may be seen by this diversity of the applications, however, there is no unique semiclassical quantization scheme for quasiparticles superconductors; thus, the validity of the procedure is not clear. This category includes Maki's theory,[18](#page-14-0) which was later reproduced by Wasserman and Springford[21](#page-14-0) by treating the BTP self-energy as the extra broadening factor in the normal-state thermodynamic potential and then following Dingle's procedure.[32](#page-14-0) However, the BTP self-energy itself is obtained within the quasiclassical approximation without the Landau-level structure so that this approximation may also be questionable.\n\nThe second approach relies on some approximate analytic solutions for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations or the equivalent Gor'kov equations, such as the coherent-potential approximation,[22,23](#page-14-0) the diagonalpairing approximation,[24](#page-14-0) or the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion for the free energy with respect to the order parameter.[25,26,27](#page-14-0) However, quantitative estimations of those approximations are yet to be carried out. It should also be noted that the GL expansion necessarily integrates out the quasiparticle degrees of freedom, so that the physical origin of the extra oscillation damping may be obscured in the GL approach.\n\nThe third approach solves the BdG equations numerically without approximations.[29,30](#page-14-0) Norman et al. [29](#page-14-0) thereby extracted an analytic formula for the dHvA oscillation damping through a fitting to their numerical data.[29](#page-14-0) However, it is a two-dimensional calculation for the isotropic s-wave pairing where the number of Landau levels below the Fermi level is N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 10 at Hc2. As may be realized from the appearance of the quantized Hall effect, two-dimensional systems in high magnetic fields may be qualitatively different from threedimensional systems. Thus, the obtained formula may <span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>not be appropriate for describing real three-dimensional materials with N<sup>F</sup> ≫ 1. On the other hand, another calculation by Miller and Gy¨orffy for a two-dimensional lattice model[30](#page-14-0) corresponds to the low-field limit near Hc<sup>1</sup> [33](#page-14-0) and may not be suitable to explain the experiments. Moreover, calculations for lattice models have a flaw that they cannot yield continuous magnetic oscillation due to the commensurability condition between the underlying lattice and the vortex lattice.\n\nNotice finally that most of the above theories consider only the isotropic s-wave pairing. Especially, no numerical studies have been performed yet for anisotropic pairings or three-dimensional systems.\n\nWith these observations, we will perform both numerical and analytic calculations for three-dimensional BdG equations with various gap structures. They can be solved efficiently by the Landau-level-expansion method (LLX), which was formulated for vortex-lattice states of arbitrary pairing symmetry[34](#page-14-0) and used successfully to compare low-energy quasiparticle spectra between s- and d-wave pairings.[35](#page-14-0) We will thereby clarify how the discrete Landau levels experience quantitative changes as the pair potential grows below Hc2. Another purpose is to find out the connection between the gap anisotropy and the extra dHvA amplitude attenuation. Terashima et al. [9](#page-14-0) reported a dHvA experiment on YNi2B2C where an oscillation is observed to persist down to a field ∼0.2Hc2. On the other hand, a specific-heat experiment at H = 0 shows a power-law behavior ∝T <sup>3</sup> at low temperatures,[36](#page-14-0) indicating existence of gap anisotropy in this material. Indeed, Izawa et al. [37](#page-14-0) recently reported presence of four point nodes in the gap based on a thermal-conductivity measurement. Miyake[19](#page-14-0) argued that point or line nodes along the extremal orbit may weaken the damping, and proposed to use the dHvA effect as a probe for gap anisotropy. We examine this possibility in full details and present a quantitative theory on the issue.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a formulation to solve the BdG equations for vortexlattice states. Section [III](#page-3-0) presents calculated quasiparticle spectra and the dHvA oscillation for two-dimensional systems to clarify their basic features as well as the origin of the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state. In Sec. [IV,](#page-7-0) it is demonstrated that the gap anisotropy at H = 0 can be detectable via the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state based on both numerical and analytic calculations for three-dimensional systems with various gap structures. Section [V](#page-11-0) presents estimations of energy gap for NbSe2, Nb3Sn, and YNi2B2C using the analytic formula obtained in Appendix [C](#page-13-0). Section [VI](#page-11-0) concludes the paper with a brief summary. In Appendix [A,](#page-11-0) we derive a convenient expression for the thermodynamic potential. Appendix B summarizes the expressions of basis functions and overlap integrals used in the numerical calculations. In Appendix C, we derive an analytic expression for the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state. A brief report of the contents was already presented in Ref. [38](#page-14-0).\n\n## II. FORMULATION\n\n### A. Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\n\nThroughout the paper we will rely on the mean-field BdG equations, which obtain the quasiparticle wavefunctions u<sup>s</sup> and v ∗ <sup>s</sup> with a positive eigenvalue E<sup>s</sup> > 0 by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\_2 \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)}{\\Delta(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)} & \\frac{\\Delta(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)}{\\Delta^\\*(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)} \\\\ \\Delta^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) & -\\underline{\\mathcal{H}}^\\*(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{u}\\_s(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\\\ -\\mathbf{v}\\_s^\\*(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &= E\\_s \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{u}\\_s(\\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\\\ -\\mathbf{v}\\_s^\\*(\\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{aligned} \\tag{1}$$\n\nHere ∆ is the pair potential and H denotes the normalstate Hamiltonian in the magnetic field; both are 2×2 matrices to describe the spin degrees of freedom. The symbol † denotes Hermitian conjugate in both the coordinate and spin variables as [∆† (r1, r2)]σ1σ<sup>2</sup> =∆<sup>∗</sup> σ2σ<sup>1</sup> (r2, r1) with σ<sup>j</sup> =↑, ↓. With this definition, we can see immediately that the matrix in Eq. (1) is Hermitian.\n\nWe adopt the free-particle Hamiltonian for H:\n\n$$\\underline{\\mathcal{H}}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) = \\delta(\\mathbf{r}\\_1 - \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\left\\{ \\frac{\\left[ -i\\hbar \\nabla\\_2 + \\frac{e}{c} \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\right]^2}{2m\\_e} - \\varepsilon\\_\\mathcal{F} \\right\\} \\underline{\\mathbf{1}},\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere me, −e (e > 0), c, and ε<sup>F</sup> are the electron mass, the electron charge, the light velocity, and the chemical potential, respectively. We will not consider the spin paramagnetism throughout. We also neglect the spatial variation of the magnetic field as appropriate for the relevant high-κ materials. Then, the vector potential A can be expressed using the symmetric gauge as\n\n$$\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{2}B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{r} \\,, \\tag{3}$$\n\nwhere B denotes the average flux density, and we have chosen the field along −ˆz for convenience.\n\nThe pair potential in turn is given with respect to the quasiparticle wavefunctions as\n\n$$\n\\underline{\\Delta}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) = V(\\mathbf{r}\\_1 - \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\, \\underline{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\,, \\tag{4}\n$$\n\nwhere V denotes the interaction and Φ is the order parameter defined by\n\n$$\\underline{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\equiv \\sum\\_s \\left[ \\mathbf{u}\\_s(\\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\mathbf{v}\\_s^T(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) - \\mathbf{v}\\_s(\\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\mathbf{u}\\_s^T(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\right]$$\n\n$$\\times \\frac{1}{2} \\tanh \\frac{E\\_s}{2k\\_B T},\\tag{5}$$\n\nwith T the temperature and <sup>T</sup> denoting the transpose.\n\nIt is shown in Appendix [A](#page-11-0) that the thermodynamic potential corresponding to Eqs. (1)-(4) is given by\n\n$$\n\\Omega = -k\\_\\mathrm{B} T \\sum\\_s \\ln(1 + \\mathbf{e}^{-E\\_s/k\\_\\mathrm{B}T}) - \\sum\\_s E\\_s \\int |\\mathbf{v}\\_s(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\n\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\int \\int \\mathrm{Tr} \\, \\underline{\\Delta}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\, \\underline{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{r}\\_2, \\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\_1 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\_2 \\,, \\tag{6}\n$$\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>where Tr denotes taking trace over spin variables. This expression will be useful to obtain an analytic expression for the extra dHvA amplitude attenuation in the vortex state. The magnetization is then calculated by\n\n$$M = -\\frac{\\partial(\\Omega/\\mathcal{V})}{\\partial B},\\tag{7}$$\n\nwhere V is the volume of the system.\n\n#### B. Vortex lattices and basic vectors\n\nSolving the above equations for general non-uniform systems is a formidable task. For lattice states, however, it can be reduced into a numerically tractable problem using the symmetry that they are periodic with a single flux quantum φ<sup>0</sup> ≡ hc/2e per unit cell. We hence define a pair of basic vectors by\n\n$$\\begin{cases} \\mathbf{a}\\_1 \\equiv (a\\_{1x}, a\\_{1y}, 0) \\\\ \\mathbf{a}\\_2 \\equiv (0, a\\_2, 0) \\end{cases}, \\quad (\\mathbf{a}\\_1 \\times \\mathbf{a}\\_2) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{B} = \\pi l\\_B^2 \\,, \\quad (8)$$\n\nwhere l<sup>B</sup> ≡ p ~c/eB is the magnetic length. The basic vectors of the corresponding reciprocal lattice are then defined by\n\n$$\\begin{cases} \\mathbf{b}\\_1 \\equiv 2(\\mathbf{a}\\_2 \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) / l\\_B^2 \\\\\\ \\mathbf{b}\\_2 \\equiv 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\_1) / l\\_B^2 \\end{cases} . \\tag{9}$$\n\nWe now introduce magnetic Bloch vectors for quasiparticle eigenstates by[34](#page-14-0)\n\n$$\\mathbf{k} \\equiv \\frac{\\mu\\_1}{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}} \\mathbf{b}\\_1 + \\frac{\\mu\\_2}{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}} \\mathbf{b}\\_2 \\qquad \\left( -\\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{4} < \\mu\\_j \\le \\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{4} \\right), \\tag{10}$$\n\nand those for the center-of-mass coordinate by\n\n$$\\mathbf{q} \\equiv \\frac{\\mu\\_1}{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}} \\mathbf{b}\\_1 + \\frac{\\mu\\_2}{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}} \\mathbf{b}\\_2 \\qquad \\left( -\\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{2} < \\mu\\_j \\le \\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{2} \\right), \\tag{11}$$\n\nwhere N<sup>f</sup> is an even integer with <sup>N</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>f</sup> denoting the number of flux quanta in the system. Notice that q covers an area four times as large as that of k.\n\n#### C. Landau-level-expansion method (LLX)\n\nIt has been shown[34](#page-14-0) that the pair potential of the conventional Abrikosov lattice can be expanded in two ways with respect to (r1, r2) and (R, r) ≡ ( r1+r<sup>2</sup> 2 , r1−r2) as\n\n$$\\begin{split} \\frac{\\Delta(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)}{\\Delta(\\mathbf{r}\\_1, \\mathbf{r}\\_2)} &= \\\\ &= \\sum\\_{\\mathbf{k}\\alpha} \\sum\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2} \\Delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(\\mathbf{k}p\\_z)} \\psi\\_{N\\_1 \\mathbf{k}\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}\\_1) \\, \\psi\\_{N\\_2 \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{k}\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}\\_2) \\, \\frac{\\mathbf{e}^{ip\\_z(z\\_1 - z\\_2)}}{L} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sum\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{c}} \\sum\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{r} m p\\_z} (-1)^{N\\_\\mathbf{r}} \\hat{\\Delta}\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{r} p\\_z}^{(N\\_\\mathbf{c} m)} \\psi\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{q}}^{(\\mathbf{c})}(\\mathbf{R}) \\, \\psi\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{r} m}^{(\\mathbf{r})}(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{\\mathbf{e}^{ip\\_z z}}{L} . \\end{split} \\tag{12}$$\n\nHere ψNk<sup>α</sup> is a quasiparticle basis function with N denoting the Landau level, k defined by Eq. (10), and α (=1,2) signifying signifying two-fold degeneracy of every orbital state. On the other hand, ψ (c) Ncq and ψ (r) <sup>N</sup>r<sup>m</sup> are basis functions for the center-of-mass and relative coordinates, respectively, with N<sup>c</sup> and N<sup>r</sup> denoting the corresponding Landau levels, q defined by Eq. (11), and m an eigenvalue for the relative orbital angular momentum operator ˆlz. The quantities p<sup>z</sup> and L are, respectively, the wavenumber and the system length along the z direction parallel to the magnetic field; we adopt a notation of using p as a wavevector in zero field to distinguish it from the two-dimensional magnetic Bloch vector k perpendicular to the field. As noted in Ref. [39,](#page-14-0) an arbitrary single q suffices to describe the conventional Abrikosov lattices due to the broken translational symmetry of the vortex lattice. Then the first expansion of Eq. (12) tells us that, by choosing q = 0, we get an complete analogy with the uniform system in that the pairing occurs between (k, pz) and (−k, −pz). Finally, the two expansion coefficients ∆(kpz) N1N<sup>2</sup> and ∆¯ (Ncm) Nrp<sup>z</sup> are connected by\n\n$$\\Delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(\\mathbf{k}p\\_z)} = \\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}}{2} \\sum\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{c} N\\_\\mathbf{r}} \\langle N\\_1 N\\_2 | N\\_\\mathbf{c} N\\_\\mathbf{r} \\rangle \\sum\\_m \\langle 2\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q} | m + N\\_\\mathbf{r} \\rangle$$\n\n$$\\times (-1)^{N\\_\\mathbf{r}} \\Delta\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{r} p\\_z}^{(N\\_\\mathbf{c} m)},\\qquad(13a)$$\n\n$$\\bar{\\Delta}\\_{N\\_\\mathbf{r} p\\_z}^{(N\\_\\mathbf{c} m)} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{M}} \\sum \\left\\langle N\\_\\mathbf{c} N\\_\\mathbf{r} | N\\_1 N\\_2 \\right\\rangle \\sum \\langle m + N\\_\\mathbf{r} | 2\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q} \\rangle$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta\\_{N\\_r p\\_z}^{(N\\_c m)} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{N}\\_\\mathbf{f}} \\sum\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2} \\langle N\\_\\mathbf{c} N\\_\\mathbf{r} | N\\_1 N\\_2 \\rangle \\sum\\_\\mathbf{k} \\langle m + N\\_\\mathbf{r} | 2\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q} \\rangle\n$$\n\n$$\n\\times (-1)^{N\\_\\mathbf{r}} \\Delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(\\mathbf{k} p\\_z)}, \\tag{13b}\n$$\n\nwhere hN1N2|NcNri and h2k−q|m+Nri are elements of unitary matrices for the basis change, i.e. overlap integrals. Their explicit expressions together with those for ψNkα, ψ (c) Ncq , and ψ (r) <sup>N</sup>r<sup>m</sup> are given in Appendix [B.](#page-12-0)\n\nA great advantage of using Eq. (12) is that it enables us to transform Eq. [\\(1](#page-1-0)) into a numerically tractable problem, as mentioned before. Indeed, expanding the quasiparticle wavefunctions as\n\n$$\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum\\_{N\\mathbf{k}\\alpha p\\_x} \\mathbf{u}\\_s(N) \\,\\psi\\_{N\\mathbf{k}\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\frac{\\mathbf{e}^{ip\\_z z}}{\\sqrt{L}},\\tag{14a}$$\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum\\_{N\\mathbf{k}\\alpha p\\_x} \\mathbf{v}\\_s(N) \\,\\psi\\_{N\\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{k}\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\frac{\\mathbf{e}^{-ip\\_z z}}{\\sqrt{L}},\\quad \\text{(14b)}$$\n\nEq. [\\(1](#page-1-0)) is reduced to a separate matrix eigenvalue problem for each kαpz, and the eigenstate is labelled by s=νkαpzσ with ν and σ denoting the quasiparticle band and its spin, respectively. Explicitly, Eq.([1\\)](#page-1-0) becomes\n\n$$\\sum\\_{N\\_2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\underbrace{\\mathcal{U}\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(p\\_z)}}\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2} & \\Delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(\\mathbf{k} p\\_x)} \\\\ \\Delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(\\mathbf{k} p\\_z) \\dagger} & -\\underline{\\mathcal{U}}\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(p\\_x)} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{u}\\_s(N\\_2) \\\\ -\\mathbf{v}\\_s^\\*(N\\_2) \\end{bmatrix} = E\\_s \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{u}\\_s(N\\_1) \\\\ -\\mathbf{v}\\_s^\\*(N\\_1) \\end{bmatrix},\\tag{15}$$\n\nwhere ∆(kpz) N1N<sup>2</sup> is given by Eq. (13a), and H (pz) N1N2 is diag<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>onal as\n\n$$\\mathcal{H}\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2}^{(p\\_z)} = \\delta\\_{N\\_1 N\\_2} \\left[ (N\\_1 + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega\\_B + \\frac{\\hbar^2 p\\_z^2}{2m\\_e} - \\varepsilon\\_\\mathcal{F} \\right] \\underline{\\mathsf{L}}, \\quad (16)$$\n\nwith ω<sup>B</sup> ≡eB/M c the cyclotron frequency.\n\nThe self-consistency equation([4\\)](#page-1-0) are also simplified greatly. Let us define\n\n$$\\begin{split} V\\_{\\mathbf{pp'}} & \\equiv \\int V(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p'}) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 r \\\\ &= 4\\pi \\sum\\_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\sum\\_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} \\bar{V}\\_{\\ell}(p,p') Y\\_{\\ell m}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}) Y\\_{\\ell m}^\\*(\\hat{\\mathbf{p'}}) \\,, \\end{split} \\tag{17}$$\n\nwhere Yℓm(pˆ) ≡ Θℓm(θp) <sup>√</sup> 1 2π exp(imϕp) is the spherical harmonic.[40](#page-14-0) We also expand both ∆ and Φ in terms of the center-of-mass and relative coordinates as the last line of Eq.([12\\)](#page-2-0). Then Eq. [\\(4](#page-1-0)) is transformed into an equation for the expansion coefficients of each (Nc, m) as\n\n$$\\bar{\\Delta}\\_{N\\_{\\rm r}p\\_{z}}^{(N\\_{c}m)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi l\\_{B}^{2}L} \\sum\\_{\\ell N\\_{\\rm r}'p\\_{z}'} \\bar{V}\\_{\\ell}(p,p') \\Theta\\_{\\ell m}(\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}}) \\Theta\\_{\\ell m}(\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}'}) \\bar{\\underline{\\Phi}}\\_{N\\_{\\rm r}'p\\_{z}'}^{(N\\_{c}m)} \\tag{18}$$\n\nwith p= p Nr/l<sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> +p 2 <sup>z</sup> and θ<sup>p</sup> = tan−<sup>1</sup> √ Nr/l<sup>B</sup> p<sup>z</sup> .\n\nLet us further assume that a single ℓ is relevant in Eq. (17) and take the corresponding V¯ <sup>ℓ</sup>(p, p′ ) in a separable form as\n\n$$\n\\bar{V}\\_{\\ell}(p, p') = V\\_{\\ell} \\, W\\_{\\ell}(\\xi) W\\_{\\ell}(\\xi') \\,, \\tag{19}\n$$\n\nwhere Wℓ(ξ) is some cut-off function with respect to ξ≡ ~ 2p <sup>2</sup>/2me−ε<sup>F</sup> satisfying <sup>W</sup>ℓ(0)= 1. Then can rewrite Eq. (18) as\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Delta}\\_{N\\_{\\rm r}p\\_z}^{(N\\_{\\rm c}m)} = \\tilde{\\Delta}^{(N\\_{\\rm c}m)} W\\_{\\ell}(\\xi) \\Theta\\_{\\ell m}(\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}}) \\,, \\tag{20a}\n$$\n\nwith ξ=~ 2 (Nr/l<sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> +p 2 z )/2me−ε<sup>F</sup> and\n\n$$\\underline{\\tilde{\\Delta}}^{(N\\_{c}m)} = \\frac{V\\_{\\ell}}{2\\pi l\\_{B}^{2}L} \\sum\\_{N\\_{\\mathbf{r}}'p\\_{x}'} W\\_{\\ell}(\\xi') \\Theta\\_{\\ell m}(\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}'}) \\,\\underline{\\underline{\\Phi}}\\_{N\\_{\\mathbf{r}}'p\\_{x}'}^{(N\\_{c}m)} \\,. \\tag{20b}$$\n\nThus, we only need a self-consistent solution for a set of discrete parameters {∆˜ (Ncm) (T, B)} through Eqs. [\\(15](#page-2-0)) and (20) using Eq. [\\(13\\)](#page-2-0).\n\nIt has been shown[39,](#page-14-0)[41](#page-15-0) that retaining a few Nc's, e.g., N<sup>c</sup> = 0, 6, 12 for the hexagonal lattice, is sufficient to describe the vortex lattices of H &0.05Hc2. Thus, the original problem of obtaining self-consistency for ∆(r1, r2) at all space points is now reduced to the one for a few expansion coefficients {∆˜ (Ncm) (T, B)}. This situation is analogous to the zero-field case where a single parameter ∆0(T ) specifies the pair potential.\n\nThe linearized self-consistency equation is obtained by substituting into Eq.

(21) determines the mean-field Hc2(T ), i.e. Tc(H). If we use the asymptotic expression [\\(B6](#page-13-0)) for the overlap integral hNcNr|N1N2i and replace the sum over N<sup>1</sup> by the integral over x ≡ (N<sup>1</sup> − N2)/ p 2(Nc+Nr), we reproduce the smooth quasiclassical H quasi c2 (T ) obtained, for example, for the s-wave pairing by Helfand and Werthamer.[42](#page-15-0)\n\nFinally, Eq. [\\(4](#page-1-0)) for two-dimensional systems can be transformed similarly. It is also obtained from Eqs. (17)- (20) by replacing Vℓ(p, p′ ) → V (m) (p, p′ ), extending the summation over m in Eq. (17) from −∞ to ∞, and finally restricting the summation over ℓ and p<sup>z</sup> only to ℓ= 0 and p<sup>z</sup> = 0, respectively.\n\n#### III. TWO-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS\n\nWe first consider a couple of two-dimensional models and perform fully self-consistent calculations. Our purposes in this section are summarized as follows: (i) to clarify the essential features of the results by selfconsistent calculations; (ii) to see whether point nodes in the gap really enhances the dHvA signals as Miyake claims.[19](#page-14-0)\n\n#### A. Models\n\nThe one-particle Hamiltonian([2\\)](#page-1-0) yields an isotropic Fermi surface specified by a unit vector pˆ = (cosϕp,sin ϕp). As for the pairing interaction (17), we adopt the following models:\n\n$$V\\_{\\mathbf{pp'}} = \\begin{cases} V\\_0 \\, W(\\xi) W(\\xi') \\\\ V\\_2 \\, W(\\xi) (\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_x^2 - \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_y^2) \\, W(\\xi') (\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_x'^2 - \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_y'^2) \\end{cases},\\tag{22}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$W(\\xi) = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\xi}{\\hbar \\omega\\_{\\rm D}}\\right)^{4}\\right] \\tag{23}$$\n\nis a smooth cut-off function with ω<sup>D</sup> a cut-off frequency. The second model of Eq. (22) is beyond the original isotropic interaction (17), but it is convenient for the above-mentioned purposes. In zero field, the two interactions yield the s- and dx2−<sup>y</sup> <sup>2</sup> -wave gaps as\n\n$$\\Delta\\_{\\mathbf{p}} = \\begin{cases} \\Delta\\_0 W(\\xi) \\, i \\underline{\\sigma}\\_2 & \\text{: } s \\text{-wave} \\\\ \\Delta\\_0 W(\\xi) (\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_x^2 - \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_y^2) \\, i \\underline{\\sigma}\\_2 & \\text{: } d\\_{x^2 - y^2} \\text{-wave} \\end{cases}, \\quad (24)$$\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>respectively. The corresponding ∆¯ (Ncm) N<sup>r</sup> of Eq. [\\(20](#page-3-0)) for Bkzˆ is given by\n\n$$\\underline{\\Delta}\\_{N\\_{\\rm r}}^{(N\\_{\\rm c}m)} = \\begin{cases} \\tilde{\\Delta}^{(N\\_{\\rm c})} W(\\xi) \\,\\delta\\_{m0} \\, i \\underline{\\sigma}\\_2 \\\\\\\\ \\tilde{\\Delta}^{(N\\_{\\rm c})} W(\\xi) \\frac{\\delta\\_{m2} + \\delta\\_{m-2}}{2} \\, i \\underline{\\sigma}\\_2 \\end{cases}, \\qquad (25a)$$\n\nwith <sup>ξ</sup>≡<sup>~</sup> <sup>2</sup>Nr/2mel 2 <sup>B</sup> −ε<sup>F</sup> and\n\n$$\\tilde{\\Delta}^{(N\\_c)} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{V\\_0}{4\\pi l\\_B^2} \\sum\\_{N\\_r'} W\\_\\ell(\\xi') \\,\\bar{\\Phi}\\_{N\\_r'}^{(N\\_c, 0)} \\\\\\\\ \\frac{V\\_2}{4\\pi l\\_B^2} \\sum\\_{N\\_r'} W\\_\\ell(\\xi') \\,\\frac{\\bar{\\Phi}\\_{N\\_r'}^{(N\\_c, 2)} + \\bar{\\Phi}\\_{N\\_r'}^{(N\\_c, -2)}}{2} \\end{cases} \\text{(25b)}$$\n\nHere we have adopted a normalization for ∆˜ (Nc) different from Eq. [\\(20\\)](#page-3-0) so that ∆˜ (Nc) acquires a direct correspondence to the maximum gap ∆<sup>0</sup> in Eq.([24\\)](#page-3-0); the factor <sup>1</sup> 2 in the second case stems from cos 2ϕ<sup>p</sup> in Eq. [\\(24](#page-3-0)).\n\nWe have chosen V<sup>ℓ</sup> in Eq.([22\\)](#page-3-0) as\n\n$$g\\_{\\ell} \\equiv -N(0)V\\_{\\ell} = 0.5\\ ,\\tag{26}$$\n\nwhere N(0) = me/2π~ 2 is the density of states per spin at the Fermi level. Another important parameter is the zero-temperature coherence length defined by\n\n$$\n\\xi\\_0 \\equiv \\hbar v\\_{\\rm F} / \\Delta\\_0 \\,, \\tag{27}\n$$\n\nwith v<sup>F</sup> the Fermi velocity. We have adopted pFξ<sup>0</sup> = 5 for our calculations. The above two quantities fix our models completely; the cut-off ~ω<sup>D</sup> in Eq. [\\(23](#page-3-0)) and Tc(B = 0) are calculated using the gap equation.\n\nIt should be noted that choosing pFξ<sup>0</sup> also determines the following quantities: (i) the ratio <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 /kBTc, where <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 is the zero-temperature cyclotron energy at the quasiclassical upper critical field H quasi c2 ; (ii) the number N<sup>F</sup> of the Landau levels below the Fermi level at H quasi c2 . Indeed, using the usual cut-off model <sup>W</sup>(ξ)=θ(~ω<sup>D</sup> − |ξp|) with <sup>θ</sup> the step function, we obtain the following results for the s-wave pairing:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} \\hbar \\omega\\_{H\\_{c2}^{\\text{quasi}}} / k\\_{\\text{B}} T\\_{\\text{c}} = 6.28 / p\\_{\\text{F}} \\xi\\_{\\text{0}} \\, , \\\\\\ N\\_{\\text{F}} \\equiv \\varepsilon\\_{\\text{F}} / \\hbar \\omega\\_{H\\_{c2}^{\\text{quasi}}} = 0.140 (p\\_{\\text{F}} \\xi\\_{\\text{0}})^2 \\, . \\end{cases} \\tag{28}$$\n\nTo reproduce the experimental situation <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 /kBT<sup>c</sup> = 1 ∼ 3 within the present model, we should go into the quantum limit pFξ<sup>0</sup> = 6 ∼ 2, but we then have N<sup>F</sup> = 5 ∼ 1. In real materials, however, <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 /kBT<sup>c</sup> and pFξ<sup>0</sup> are apparently independent parameters due to effects not covered by the free-particle model such as the energy band structure. Indeed, pFξ<sup>0</sup> is of the order of 30 (NbSe2) or even larger, whereas <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 /kBT<sup>c</sup> = 1∼3; see Table [I](#page-11-0) below. Also, N<sup>F</sup> ≫1 for those materials. The failures to describe these situations are among the main difficulties of the free-particle model of Eq.([2\\)](#page-1-0).\n\nMotivated by these observations, we also perform another calculations with much more Landau levels below the Fermi level. This is achieved by including the effect of the band dispersion. Specifically, we apply the Onsager-Lifshiz (OL) quantization scheme to H of Eq. ([1\\)](#page-1-0), i.e. the procedure which has been very successful for describing the dHvA oscillations in the normal state.[1](#page-14-0),[2](#page-14-0) Given the density of states per spin N(ε) and the average flux density B, the Nth Landau level ε<sup>N</sup> (N = 0, 1, 2, · · ·) is determined by\n\n$$2\\left(N+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar^2}{l\\_B^2} = 4\\pi\\hbar^2 \\int\\_0^{\\varepsilon\\_N} N(\\varepsilon') \\,d\\varepsilon'.\\tag{29}$$\n\nWe fix H (pz) N1N<sup>2</sup> of Eq. [\\(15](#page-2-0)) in this way assuming it is diagonal. In contrast, we use the same expression for ∆(kpz) N1N<sup>2</sup> of Eq. [\\(15\\)](#page-2-0) as the free-particle case. Finally, we choose ξ=εNr/2−ε<sup>F</sup> in Eq. (25) based on the consideration of the free-particle model.[34](#page-14-0) With these prescriptions together with the transformation([13\\)](#page-2-0), the coupled equations [\\(15](#page-2-0)) and (25) are defined unambiguously. We adopt the model density of states:\n\n$$N(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{m\\_{\\text{e}}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\Gamma}{\\varepsilon^2 + \\Gamma^2} \\right),\\tag{30}$$\n\nand choose the numerical constants (α, Γ)= (2.1, 2.7) and (5.0, 1.0) for the s- and d-wave models of Eq.([24\\)](#page-3-0), respectively. We also use Eq. (26) for the pairing interaction and fix ~ω<sup>D</sup> = 0.5ε<sup>F</sup> in Eq. [\\(23](#page-3-0)). We thereby obtain <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 ≈ kBT<sup>c</sup> at T = 0 and N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 30 at H = H quasi c2 , which describe the experimental situation much better than the free-particle model.\n\n#### B. Numerical procedures\n\nCoupled equations [\\(15\\)](#page-2-0) and (25) are solved iteratively with the help of the transformation [\\(13](#page-2-0)) to obtain selfconsistent {∆˜ (Nc)}'s and the corresponding quasiparticle eigenstates. The hexagonal (square) vortex lattice is assumed for the s-wave (dx2−y<sup>2</sup> -wave) model, as expected theoretically in high magnetic fields[43,44](#page-15-0) and observed recently in La1.83Sr0.17CuO4+δ. [45](#page-15-0) It should be noted, however, that the precise lattice structure is not important for the theory of the dHvA oscillation in superconductors. We set q= 1 2 (b1+b2) in the relevant equations so that a core of the pair potential is located at the origin R=0. [39](#page-14-0) An advantage of this choice is that the corresponding quasiparticle energies have the rotational symmetry of the hexagonal (square) lattice around k=0; other choices would shift the rotation axis from the origin. We then perform calculations of Eqs.([15\\)](#page-2-0) and (25) for a set of discrete k's defined by Eq.([10\\)](#page-2-0), where N<sup>f</sup> is chosen as a multiple of 12 to include all the high-symmetry points Γ, M, and K (Γ, X, and M) of the hexagonal (square) lattice. Three different values N<sup>f</sup> = 12, 24, 36 are used to see the size dependence, and it has been checked that the results do not differ for the three cases. The hexagonal (square) symmetry enables us to restrict the summation\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 1: The upper critical field H<sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> as a function of T for (a) s-wave and (b) d-wave of Eq.([24\\)](#page-3-0).

Thus, the calculations can be reduced greatly with due care on the degeneracy of high-symmetry points. Finally, the obtained eigenvalues and eigenstates are substituted into Eq.

Results\n\nThe above self-consistent procedure is known to give rise to oscillatory singular behaviors in both Hc<sup>2</sup> and ∆˜ (Nc) in the field range where the dHvA oscillation persists.[46](#page-15-0),[47](#page-15-0),[48](#page-15-0) Figure 1 displays Hc2(T ) calculated selfconsistently for the s- and d-wave models; it is normalized by the quasiclassical upper critical field H quasi c2 (T = 0).

The number of the Landau levels below the Fermi level is N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 10 around H quasi c2 (0), which is considerably smaller than those for the real materials. Figure [2](#page-5-0) shows ∆˜ (Nc) as a function of B at T = 0.1T<sup>c</sup> for the s-wave hexagonal lattice (first column) and the dwave square lattice (second column); they are real and finite only for N<sup>c</sup> = 0, 6, 12, · · · (0, 4, 8, · · ·) for the hexagonal (square) lattice,[39](#page-14-0)[,41](#page-15-0) as already mentioned. We observe that ∆˜ (Nc) 's are also singular, and the dominant ∆˜ (0) component cannot be described by the square-root behavior near H quasi c2 (0) expected from the quasiclassical theory. However, those singular behaviors disappear gradually as B decreases.\n\nFigure [3](#page-5-0) displays the quasiparticle energies in the magnetic Brillouin zone for the s-wave hexagonal lattice (first column) and the d-wave square lattice (second column) at B/Hquasi c2 (0)= 0.8, 0.5, and 0.1. At B/Hquasi c2 (0)= 0.8, we already observe large dispersion for E .2∆<sup>0</sup> where the pair potential is effective. In contrast, the flat Landaulevel structure remains for E & 2∆<sup>0</sup> where the pair potential vanishes in the present cut-off model of Eq. [\\(23\\)](#page-3-0). Thus, the dispersion is caused clearly by the scattering from the growing pair potential, and as will be discussed below, it is the origin of the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state. We also notice that, for B/Hquasi c2 (0) & 0.5, almost no qualitative difference can be seen between the s- and d-wave cases. At a lower field of B/Hquasi c2 (0)= 0.1, however, a marked difference grows around E . ∆0. The s-wave energy bands of E . 0.7∆<sup>0</sup> are flat and occur in pairs with the level spacing of the order of ∆<sup>2</sup> 0 /εF. As already pointed out by Norman et al., [29](#page-14-0) these corresponds to the bound core states of an isolated vortex with little tunneling probability between adjacent cores. In contrast, the d-wave bands in the same region are densely packed with large dispersion, indicating the extended nature of the corresponding quasiparticle wavefunctions. From this comparison, we conclude that no bound states exist for the d-wave model even in the zero-field limit of an isolated vortex, in agreement with the result of Franz and Teˇsanovi´c.[49](#page-15-0) This difference in the low-energy dispersion at low fields was already reported\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 5: The expansion coefficients ∆˜ (Nc) in Eq.([25\\)](#page-4-0) as a function of B for the s-wave (first column) and the d-wave (second column). Here T = 0.1Tc, and the non-quadratic dispersion given by Eq. [\\(30\\)](#page-4-0) is used. The dotted lines in the first row signify the square-root behavior expected from the quasiclassical theory.\n\nin Ref. [35.](#page-14-0)\n\nFigure 4 shows oscillatory part of the magnetization Mosc calculated numerically by Eq.([7\\)](#page-2-0), where curves of the corresponding normal state are also plotted for comparison. The damping starts from above H quasi c2 (0) where ∆˜ (0) is already finite as in Fig. [2,](#page-5-0) and develops rapidly as ∆˜ (0) grows in decreasing B. Thus, the mean-field theory predicts that the dHvA oscillation comes together with the oscillatory singular behaviors in Hc<sup>2</sup> and ∆˜ (Nc) . Combined with the energy dispersion given in Fig. [3,](#page-5-0) we are now able to attribute the origin of the extra damping unambiguously to the Landau-level broadening due to the pair potential. The oscillations are rather irregular in both the s-wave and d-wave cases, in accordance with the singular behaviors of ∆(Nc) in Fig. [2.](#page-5-0) We also see no qualitative difference between the two cases.\n\nHowever, the free-particle model has several inappropriate points as discussed already around Eq. [\\(28](#page-4-0)). For example, the number of Landau levels below the Fermi level N<sup>F</sup> is necessarily N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 10 at H quasi c2 for pFξ<sup>0</sup> = 5, which is much smaller than the values of the materials displaying the dHvA oscillation. Hence the above numerical results may not be sufficient to say anything quantitative about the dHvA attenuation or the differences between the s- and d-wave cases. We have thus\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 6: Oscillatory part of magnetization Mosc for (a) the s-wave and (b) the d-wave, over 0.8 .

Singular oscillatory behaviors are manifest in both cases as in the case of the quadratic dispersion, which originate from the singular density of states of Landau levels.[48](#page-15-0) For example, the dominant ∆˜ (0) component have a nonzero value from above H quasi c2 and deviates substantially from the quasiclassical square-root behavior (dotted lines).\n\nFigure 6 displays the corresponding oscillatory part of the magnetization Mosc calculated numerically by Eq. ([7\\)](#page-2-0), where normal-state results (dotted lines) are also plotted for comparison. The main features are summarized as follows: (i) The oscillations are seen to decrease from above the quasiclassical H quasi c2 , due to the reentrant behavior of ∆˜ (Nc) , to be reduced considerably around B ∼ 0.8H quasi c2 , i.e. H quasi c2 /B ∼ 1.25. However, they do not disappear completely in lower fields. (ii) This extra attenuation is due to the broadening of the Landau levels caused by the pair potential, as in the case of the quadratic dispersion. Indeed, we have obtained quasiparticle spectra similar to those of Fig. [3.](#page-5-0) (iii) The period of the oscillation remains unchanged above ∼0.8H quasi c2 , but some irregularity appears in lower fields. These features are in agreement with the results by Norman et al. [29](#page-14-0) (iv) Little difference can be seen between the s- and d-wave attenuations.\n\n#### D. Summary of Two-Dimensional Calculations\n\nLet us summarize results and conclusions from our twodimensional calculations. (i) Combining Figs. [3](#page-5-0) and [4](#page-6-0), we are now able to attribute the origin of the extra dHvA oscillation damping unambiguously to the Landau-level broadening due to the scattering by the pair potential. (ii) As may be realized from Fig. 6, presence of point\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 7: Oscillatory part of magnetization Mosc for (a) the s-wave and (b) the d-wave. The difference from Fig. 7 lies in the use of quasiclassical ∆(0)'s given by the dotted lines in Fig. [5](#page-6-0).\n\nnodes along the extremal orbit does not weaken the attenuation, contrary to the statement by Miyake.[19](#page-14-0) This fact suggests that the attenuation is determined by the average gap along the extremal orbit. (iii) The meanfield theory predicts that the dHvA oscillation comes together with the oscillatory behaviors in Hc<sup>2</sup> and ∆˜ (Nc) . This will be so in three dimensional models where Hc2(T ) also shows an oscillatory behavior.[48](#page-15-0) However, such singular behaviors of Hc<sup>2</sup> have never been identified definitely in any materials displaying the dHvA oscillation, and reported Hc<sup>2</sup> curves show more or less the smooth quasiclassical behavior. This discrepancy between the mean-field theory and the dHvA experiments remains a puzzle to be resolved in the future. (iv) The oscillation attenuates considerably around B ∼ 0.8H quasi c2 , i.e. H quasi c2 /B <sup>∼</sup>1.25, although we have set <sup>~</sup>ω<sup>H</sup> quasi c2 /kBT<sup>c</sup> ∼1 and N<sup>F</sup> ≫1 at H quasi c2 . Thus, the two dimensional models fail to explain the experiment by Terashima et al. [9](#page-14-0) which shows a persistent oscillation down to 0.2Hc2. In addition, the models cannot say anything about whether presence of a line node along the extremal orbit weakens the attenuation. (v) The approximation of retaining only ∆˜ (0) works excellently for calculating Mosc. Indeed, we have checked that the curves of Mosc thereby obtained are almost indistinguishable from those of Fig. 6. (vi) The discrepancy mentioned in (iii) above suggests that we should rather use ∆˜ (0) obtained quasiclassically to reproduce the smooth behaviors of Hc<sup>2</sup> in real materials. Figure 7 plots curves of Mosc calculated using quasiclassical ∆˜ (0), i.e. the dotted lines of Fig. [5](#page-6-0). The oscillations are seen more regular than those of Fig. 6, but the amplitudes attenuate almost similarly and are reduced considerably around H quasi c2 /B ∼1.25. We hence realize that using the quasiclassical ∆˜ (0) suffices for the theory of the oscillation damping. This statement is especially true in the low-field region ∼ 0.2H quasi <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> where ∆˜ (0) approaches to the quasiclassical behavior, as may be realized from Fig. [5](#page-6-0).\n## <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>IV. THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS\n\nHaving clarified basic features of the dHvA oscillation for two-dimensional models as well as the mechanism of the extra oscillation damping, we proceed to consider three-dimensional models with various gap structures which are more relevant to real materials. Our purposes in this section are summarized as follows: (i) to clarify the connection between the extra dHvA oscillation damping and the gap anisotropy by numerical calculations; (ii) to obtain an analytic formula for the extra oscillation damping; (iii) to estimate the gap magnitudes of various materials using the obtained analytic formula.\n\n## A. Model\n\nThe one-particle Hamiltonian [\\(2](#page-1-0)) yields a spherical Fermi surface in the normal state. As for the pairing interaction, we consider three different models:\n\n$$V\\_{\\mathbf{pp'}} = \\begin{cases} V\\_0 \\, W(\\xi) W(\\xi') \\\\ V\\_2 \\, W(\\xi) (\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_x^2 - \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_y^2) \\, W(\\xi') (\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_x'^2 - \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\_y'^2) \\, . \\end{cases} \\\\ (31)$$\n \n$$V\\_1 \\, W(\\xi) \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{c}} \\, W(\\xi') \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}' \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$$\n\nHere W(ξ) is a cut-off function given by Eq.([23\\)](#page-3-0), pˆ ≡ (sin θ<sup>p</sup> cosϕp,sin θ<sup>p</sup> sin ϕp, cos θp) specifies a point on the Fermi surface, and cˆ≡(sin θc, 0, cos θc) denotes the direction of the crystal c-axis, in the coordinate frame where Bkzˆ.

[III D\\(](#page-7-0)vi), we here adopt a quasiclassical ∆˜ (Nc) rather than the fully selfconsistent one.

Now, the matrix elements of Eq.([15\\)](#page-2-0) are specified completely. Hexagonal, square, and hexagonal lattices are assumed for the three cases of Eq. [\\(33](#page-8-0)), respectively.\n\n## B. Numerical Procedures\n\nThe wavevector p<sup>z</sup> of 0≤p<sup>z</sup> ≤1.2p<sup>F</sup> is discretized into ∼ 1000 points with an equal interval. For each of them, we have diagonalized Eq. [\\(15](#page-2-0)) with the same procedure as described in Sec. [III B.](#page-4-0) The obtained results are substituted into Eq. [\\(6](#page-1-0)) to calculate the magnetization by Eq.([7](#page-2-0)). All the calculations are performed at T = 0.\n\n## C. Numerical Results\n\nWe first focus on the dHvA oscillation of the s-wave model in Eq. [\\(32](#page-8-0)) to clarify its basic features. Using our numerical data, we also test the applicability of various theoretical formulas presented so far.\n\nFigure 8(a) presents oscillation of the s-wave magnetization (blue line) as compared with the normal-state one (sky-blue line). With ~ωHc<sup>2</sup> =kBTc, the oscillation is observed to persist down to a fairly low field of Hc2/B .1.8, i.e., B & 0.55Hc2, which is smaller than 0.8Hc<sup>2</sup> around which ~ω<sup>B</sup> becomes equal to the spatial average of the energy gap, Eq. [\\(35](#page-8-0)). This is partly because the gap is smaller within the extremal orbit, as shown quasiclassically by Brandt et al. [31](#page-14-0) Indeed, Fig. 9 calculated at B = 0.968Hc<sup>2</sup> demonstrates that the dispersion for p<sup>z</sup> = 0 is smaller than that for p<sup>z</sup> = 0.9pF. This tendency remains in the high-field region of B &0.5Hc2.\n\nIt has become conventional to express this extra attenuation in the vortex state by introducing an additional factor R<sup>s</sup> for the dHvA oscillation amplitude:\n\n$$R\\_{\\rm s} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega\\_B \\tau\\_{\\rm s}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi^2 k\\_{\\rm B} T\\_{\\Delta}}{\\hbar \\omega\\_B}\\right),\\qquad(38)$$\n\n![](0__page_9_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 9: Quasiparticle dispersion in the magnetic Brillouin zone for the s-wave model at B = 0.968H<sup>c</sup>2. (a) pz=0; (b) pz=0.9pF.\n\nwhere the parameters τ<sup>s</sup> and T<sup>∆</sup> are directly connected with the extra Landau-level broadening Γ<sup>s</sup> in the vortex state as Γ<sup>s</sup> = ~/2τ<sup>s</sup> = πkBT∆. The points with error bars in Fig. 8(b) shows ln R<sup>s</sup> as a function of 1/B, i.e. the Dingle plot, obtained by numerical differentiation. This extra damping at high fields shows the behavior ∝1−B/Hc<sup>2</sup> in the logarithmic scale, but irregularity sets in around 0.55Hc<sup>2</sup> where the oscillation disappears. We attribute this irregularity to the effect of the bound-state formation in the core region.\n\nThe lines in Fig. 8(b) are the predictions from various theoretical formulas. Maki's formula[18](#page-14-0) reproduces the correct functional behavior ∝ 1−B/Hc<sup>2</sup> at high fields, but the prefactor is seen too large. The NMA formula,[29](#page-14-0) deduced from the two-dimensional self-consistent numerical results with N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 10 at Hc2, predicts a more rapid attenuation incompatible with our numerical data. One reason for this discrepancy may originate from the fact that their numerical data with N<sup>F</sup> ∼ 10 at Hc<sup>2</sup> are not appropriate for obtaining an analytic formula by fitting. Another may be attributed to the difference in dimensions. Indeed, the dHvA oscillation in three dimensions differs from that in two dimensions on the point that some finite region δp<sup>z</sup> around the extremal orbit is relevant. Most of the Landau levels in the region do not satisfy the particle-hole symmetry with respect to εF, so that the effect of the pair potential becomes smaller than that in two dimensions. Another theory by Dukan and Teˇsanovi´c,[24](#page-14-0) which would predict Rs= 0 in the clean limit of T = 0, is also inconsistent with the data.\n\nThe red line in Fig. 8(b) is due to our formula for the extra Dingle temperature:\n\n$$k\\_{\\rm B}T\\_{\\Delta} = 0.5 \\tilde{\\Gamma} \\langle |\\Delta\\_{\\rm p}|^2 \\rangle\\_{\\rm eo} \\frac{m\\_{\\rm b}c}{\\pi e \\hbar} \\frac{1 - B/H\\_{c2}}{B},\\tag{39}$$\n\nwhich is derived in Appendix [C](#page-13-0) based on the second-order perturbation with respect to the pair potential.

The numerical constant 0.5 stems from Eq. [\\(36](#page-8-0)), and Γ is a dimension- ˜ less quantity characterizing the Landau-level broadening due to the pair potential. This unknown parameter Γ is ˜ determined by a best fit to the s-wave numerical data, i.e. the points with error bars in Fig. [8\\(](#page-9-0)b). This procedure yields\n\nΓ= 0 ˜ .125 .\n\nWe observe in Fig. [8](#page-9-0)(b) that Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)), which predicts the dependence ∝ 1−B/Hc<sup>2</sup> for ln Rs, agrees with the numerical results. This formula will be seen below to reproduce other numerical data excellently without any adjustable parameters.\n\nA difference of Eq.([39](#page-9-0)) from Maki's formula[18](#page-14-0) lies in the prefactor where the Fermi velocity v<sup>F</sup> is absent. Indeed, a dimensional analysis on the second-order perturbation tells us that the Landau-level broadening in the vortex state should be of order <sup>|</sup>∆˜(0)(B)<sup>|</sup> <sup>2</sup>/~ωB, where ∆˜(0)(B) <sup>∝</sup> p h|∆p| <sup>2</sup>ieo(1−B/Hc2) is essentially the average gap along the extremal orbit. This leads to Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)) except for the numerical constant.\n\nWe now turn our attention to see how the presence of point nodes affect the dHvA oscillation. Figure 10(a) shows the oscillation of the d-wave magnetization (blue line) as compared with the normal-state one (sky-blue line). Although the d-wave gap in Eq. [\\(32](#page-8-0)) has four point nodes on the Fermi surface along the extremal orbit, the damping is seen strong and not much different from the s-wave case. From this fact, we may conclude that it is the average gap along the extremal orbit which is relevant for the extra dHvA oscillation damping. Figure 10(b) presents the corresponding Dingle plot (points with error bars), which is compared with the prediction of Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)). The formula with the average gap h|∆p| 2 ieo reproduces the numerical result for Hc2/B . 1.8 excellently without adjustable parameters, thereby providing a strong support for the above statement.\n\nThis d-wave result is in disagreement with Miyake's theory that point nodes in the extremal orbit should weaken the attenuation.[19](#page-14-0) Indeed, Miyake's theory is based on a semiclassical quantization for the expression\n\n![](0__page_10_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 11: Left figures: the oscillatory part of the magnetization Mosc in the vortex state (blue lines) as compared with the normal-state one (sky-blue lines) for the p-wave model of Eq.([32\\)](#page-8-0) at T = 0.

Right figures: the corresponding Dingle plots (points with error bars) compared with Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)).\n\nof the electron number N<sup>e</sup> at B = 0. Neither his starting point Ne(B = 0) nor the use of the semiclassical quantization may be justified for describing the dHvA oscillation observed mainly near Hc2.\n\nWe finally consider the p-wave model with a line node in Eq. [\\(32](#page-8-0)) to double-check the applicability of Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)). The left figures in Fig. 11 display the dHvA oscillation for the line-node model, where the crystal c-axis is tilted from the magnetic-field direction by θ<sup>c</sup> = 0 (top), θ<sup>c</sup> =π/6 (second), and θ<sup>c</sup> = π/4 (bottom). The damping is seen weakest in the top figure where the gap vanishes along the extremal orbit, but increases gradually as finite gap opens along the orbit for θ<sup>c</sup> = 0 → π/4. These results indicate conclusively that the average gap along the extremal orbit is relevant for the extra dHvA attenuation. However, the non-zero extra damping in the top figure implies that not only the extremal orbit alone but some finite region around it contributes to the extra damping. Theoretically, this corresponds to the fact that we have to perform the Fresnel integral R <sup>∞</sup> −∞exp[−i( √ 2πN<sup>F</sup> pz/pF) 2 ] dp<sup>z</sup> for obtaining the LK formula in the normal state. Our data show that this off-extremal-orbit contribution cannot be neglected in the case where the gap vanishes exactly\n\n<span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>TABLE I: Parameters characterizing three superconductors displaying the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state, together with values of the average gap along the extremal orbit p h|∆p| <sup>2</sup>ieo estimated by Eq.

However, this offextremal contribution is expected to become less important where finite gap is present along the extremal orbit. The right figures in Fig. [11](#page-10-0) show the corresponding Dingle plot (points with error bars), which is compared with the prediction of Eq. [\\(39\\)](#page-9-0). Except for the weak damping of θ<sup>c</sup> = 0 due to the off-extremal-orbit contribution, the formula is observed to reproduce the numerical results excellently.\n\n## V. ESTIMATION OF ENERGY GAP\n\nOur calculations in Sec. [IV C](#page-9-0) have clarified that (i) the gap anisotropy can be detected by measuring the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state, and (ii) Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)) is particularly useful for this purpose. Using the formula, we finally provide quantitative estimations of the average gap along the extremal orbit for several materials displaying the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state. Table I summarizes parameters describing three relevant materials. These materials commonly have fairly high Tc's, and the ratio ~ω<sup>H</sup>c<sup>2</sup> /kBT<sup>c</sup> ranges from 1 to 3. These features seem to be basic conditions for observing the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state. The values for p h|∆p| <sup>2</sup>ieo are obtained by applying Eq.([39\\)](#page-9-0) to the observed dHvA attenuation in the vortex state. In doing so, we have adopted as m<sup>b</sup> in Eq.([39\\)](#page-9-0) the values from dHvA experiments rather than those from band calculations, as indicated by the theory of Luttinger.[50](#page-15-0) For comparison, we have also listed the values ∆(0) estimated by a specific-heat experiment,[36](#page-14-0) a far-infrared measurement,[51](#page-15-0) a tunneling experiment,[52](#page-15-0) or a Ramanscattering experiment.[53](#page-15-0) Thus, ∆(0) is expected to represent band- and/or angle-averaged energy gap. As seen in Table I, the two quantities coincide excellently for NbSe<sup>2</sup> and Nb3Sn, indicating uniformly opened gap in these materials. On the other hand, p h|∆p| <sup>2</sup>ieo = 1.5 for the α band of YNi2B2C is considerably smaller than ∆(0)= 2.5 from a specific-heat experiment.[36](#page-14-0) This fact implies that YNi2B2C have large band- and/or angle-dependent gap anisotropy. Indeed, Bintley et al. [55](#page-15-0) have recently carried out a detailed dHvA experiment on this material, rotating the field direction and observing the extra attenuation. They have reported a large angle dependence of the attenuation magnitude. They have also pointed out that their result is in agreement with the model with point nodes presented by Izawa et al. [37](#page-14-0) based on a thermalconductivity measurement.\n\n## VI. SUMMARY\n\nWe have carried out the first three-dimensional numerical calculations on the dHvA oscillation in the vortex state for various gap structures. We have thereby clarified the relation between gap anisotropy and persistence of the oscillation. We have also derived an analytic formula for the extra dHvA attenuation in the vortex state.\n\nOur main results are given by Figs. [8](#page-9-0)-[11](#page-10-0) and Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)). Those figures indicate clearly that the extra dHvA attenuation in the vortex state is directly connected with the average gap along the extremal orbit at B = 0. The derived formula [\\(39](#page-9-0)) have been shown to reproduce the numerical results excellently. Our theory attributes the origin of the extra dHvA damping to the Landau-level broadening caused by the pair potential. Hence the periodicity of the vortex lattice assumed here is almost irrelevant, and the theory is applicable also to the cases with irregularity such as a random array of vortices. Using Eq. ([39\\)](#page-9-0), we have estimated average gap amplitudes along the extremal orbit for NbSe2, Nb3Sn, and YNi2B2C. The results indicate presence of large gap anisotropy in YNi2B2C.\n\nThus, we have shown explicitly that the dHvA effect in the vortex state can be a powerful tool to probe the average gap along the extremal orbit. Our results imply that, by rotating the field direction and observing the attenuation amplitude, we can obtain unique information on the band- and/or angle-dependent gap structure. Such an experiment has recently been performed on UPd2Al<sup>3</sup> by Inada et al. [13](#page-14-0) and on YNi2B2C by Bintley et al., [55](#page-15-0) and the latter group indeed has detected large gap anisotropy in the ab plane. Equation [\\(39](#page-9-0)) will be useful in similar experiments for estimating band- and/or angle-dependent gap amplitudes.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to F. J.

The quantity εn/~ denotes the Matsubara frequency, and 0<sup>+</sup> is an infinitesimal positive constant. Now, Eq. [\\(1](#page-1-0)) tells us that the first matrix in Eq.

The last term − 1 <sup>2</sup>Tr∆ Φ may be expressed solely with respect to the pair potential, so that they can be neglected in the present model to consider the oscillatory part. Since we are interested in the extra damping in the vortex state, we adopt as E<sup>s</sup> and v<sup>s</sup> the expressions from the secondorder perturbation with respect to ∆. They are obtained as\n\n$$E\\_{N\\mathbf{k}\\alpha p\\_z\\sigma} = |\\xi\\_{Np\\_z\\sigma}| + \\eta\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z}^{(1)}\\operatorname{sign}(\\xi\\_{Np\\_z\\sigma})\\,,\\tag{C1}$$\n\n$$\\int |\\mathbf{v}\\_{N\\mathbf{k}\\alpha p\\_z \\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d\\mathbf{r} = \\theta(-\\xi\\_{Np\\_z \\sigma}) + \\eta\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z}^{(2)} \\text{sign}(\\xi\\_{Np\\_z \\sigma})\\,,\\tag{C2}$$\n\nwhere θ is the step function, and η (n) Nkp<sup>z</sup> is defined by using Eq. [\\(13a](#page-2-0)) as\n\n$$\\eta\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_x}^{(n)} \\equiv \\sum\\_{N'} \\frac{|\\Delta\\_{NN'}^{(\\mathbf{k}p\\_x)}|^2}{(\\xi\\_{Np\\_x} + \\xi\\_{N'-p\\_x})^n}.\\tag{C3}$$\n\nThe first terms on the right-hand side of Eqs. (C1) and (C2) are just the normal-state results. The second terms, on the other hand, denote the finite quasiparticle dispersion in the magnetic Brillouin zone and the smearing of the Fermi surface, respectively, due to the scattering by the growing pair potential. It is useful to express η (n) Nkp<sup>z</sup> in terms of ∆˜(0)(B) and the cyclotron energy ~ω<sup>B</sup> of the extremal orbit as\n\n$$\\eta\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z}^{(n)} = \\frac{|\\tilde{\\Delta}^{(0)}(B)|^2}{(\\hbar \\omega\\_B)^n} \\tilde{\\eta}\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z}^{(n)} \\,. \\tag{C4}$$\n\nThe quantity ˜η (n) Nkp<sup>z</sup> thus defined is dimensionless, and we realize that the main B dependence in Eq. (C4) lies in the prefactor <sup>|</sup>∆˜(0)(B)<sup>|</sup> <sup>2</sup>/(~ωB) <sup>n</sup>. The explicit expression of ˜η (n) Nkp<sup>z</sup> is obtained by using Eqs.([13a](#page-2-0)) and [\\(33](#page-8-0)). Considering the case θ<sup>c</sup> = 0, for simplicity, it is given by\n\n$$\\begin{split} \\tilde{\\eta}^{(n)}\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{N}\\_{\\mathbf{f}}^2}{4} \\sum\\_{N'mm'} \\frac{|\\langle NN'|0 \\, N + N'\\rangle|^2 \\langle N + N'+m|2\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q}\\rangle}{[N+N'-2(N\\_{\\mathbf{F}}+\\delta)]^n} \\\\ &\\times \\langle 2\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q}|N + N'+m'\\rangle \\times \\begin{cases} \\delta\\_{m0}\\delta\\_{m'0} \\\\ \\delta\\_{m,\\pm2}\\delta\\_{m',\\pm2}\\sin^4\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}} \\\\ \\delta\\_{m0}\\delta\\_{m'0}\\cos^2\\theta\\_{\\mathbf{p}} \\end{cases}, \\end{split} \\tag{C5}$$\n\nwhere the quantity δ = δ(B, pz) (|δ| < 1/2) specifies the location of ε<sup>F</sup> between the two closest Landau levels, and the overlap integrals are defined by Eqs.([B4\\)](#page-12-0) and (B7). The corresponding normalized density of states:\n\n$$D\\_{Np\\_z}^{(n)}(\\tilde{\\eta}) \\equiv \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{N}\\_{\\rm f}^2} \\sum\\_{\\mathbf{k}\\alpha} \\delta(\\,\\tilde{\\eta} - \\,\\tilde{\\eta}\\_{N\\mathbf{k}p\\_z}^{(n)})\\,,\\tag{C6}$$\n\nwill play a central role in the following.\n\nSubstituting Eqs. (C1) and (C2) into Eq. [\\(6](#page-1-0)), we find that the terms containing η (2) <sup>N</sup>kp<sup>z</sup> may be neglected due to the cancellation between the particle and hole contributions. The remaining term can be transformed with the standard procedure.[1](#page-14-0) We thereby obtain, for the first harmonic of Ω/V , the expression:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Omega\\_1}{V} = -\\frac{k\\_\\mathrm{B}T}{2\\pi^2 l\\_B^2} \\sum\\_{\\sigma} \\int\\_{-1/2}^\\infty dN \\cos(2\\pi N) \\int\\_{-\\infty}^\\infty dp\\_z \\int\\_{-\\infty}^\\infty d\\tilde{\\eta}$$\n\n$$\\times D\\_{Np\\_z}^{(1)}(\\tilde{\\eta}) \\ln\\left[1 + e^{-\\left(\\xi\\_{Np\\_z\\sigma} + \\tilde{\\eta}\\left|\\tilde{\\Delta}^{(0)}(B)\\right|^2/\\hbar\\omega\\_B\\right)/k\\_B T}\\right]. \\quad \\text{(C7)}$$\n\nThe function D (1) Np<sup>z</sup> (˜η) depends on (N, pz), but may be replaced by a representative one D (1) ℓ (˜η) to be placed outside the N and p<sup>z</sup> integrals,[60](#page-15-0) where the recovered index ℓ specifies the s-, d-, or p-wave case of Eq. (C5). It may also be acceptable to use a Lorenzian for it: D (1) ℓ (˜η) = Γ˜ <sup>ℓ</sup>/π(˜η <sup>2</sup>+Γ˜<sup>2</sup> ℓ ).[61](#page-15-0) We thereby obtain an expression for the magnetization which carries an extra damping factor:\n\n$$\\begin{split} R\\_{\\mathsf{s}}(B) & \\equiv \\int\\_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\overline{D}\\_{\\ell}^{(1)}(\\bar{\\eta}) \\exp\\left[ -2\\pi i \\tilde{\\eta} |\\bar{\\Delta}^{(0)}(B)|^{2} / (\\hbar \\omega\\_{B})^{2} \\right] d\\bar{\\eta} \\\\ &= \\exp\\left[ -2\\pi \\tilde{\\Gamma}\\_{\\ell} |\\bar{\\Delta}^{(0)}(B)|^{2} / (\\hbar \\omega\\_{B})^{2} \\right]. \\end{split} \\tag{C8}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>Thus, the superconductivity gives rise to an extra Dingle temperature of <sup>k</sup>BT<sup>∆</sup> <sup>≡</sup> Γ˜ <sup>ℓ</sup> <sup>|</sup>∆˜(0)(B)<sup>|</sup> <sup>2</sup>/π~ωB, or equivalently, the extra scattering rate of τ −1 <sup>s</sup> <sup>≡</sup>2πkBT∆/~.\n\nEquation [\\(C8](#page-13-0)) has an advantage that one can trace the origin of the extra dHvA damping definitely to the growing pair potential, which brings finite quasiparticle dispersion in the magnetic Brillouin zone as Eq. [\\(C5](#page-13-0)), and the corresponding Landau-level broadening as Eq. ([C6](#page-13-0)). Moreover, Eq.([C5](#page-13-0)) reveals that this broadening near Hc<sup>2</sup> is closely connected with the zero-field gap structure given by Eq.([32\\)](#page-8-0).\n\n- <sup>∗</sup> URL: [http://phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/~kita/index-e.](http://phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/~kita/index-e.html) h[tml](http://phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/~kita/index-e.html); Electronic address: [kita@phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp](mailto:kita@phys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp)\n- 1 I.

Using Eq.([34\\)](#page-8-0) with a <sup>2</sup> = 0.5∆<sup>2</sup> 0 , the procedure yields Γ˜ <sup>s</sup> = 0.125, as mentioned before. It is also clear both from Figs. [10](#page-10-0) and [11](#page-10-0) and from Eq.([C5](#page-13-0)) that the average gap around the extremal orbit is relevant for the extra attenuation. We hence put a 2Γ˜ <sup>ℓ</sup> = 0.5h|∆p| 2 <sup>i</sup>eoΓ˜ s. We thereby obtain Eq. [\\(39](#page-9-0)), which yields excellent fits to the d- and p-wave numerical data without any adjustable parameters, as seen in Figs. [10](#page-10-0) and [11.](#page-10-0)\n\n- <sup>16</sup> T.

        "abstract": "Theories of quasiparticle spectra and the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation in type-II superconductors are developed based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for vortex-lattice states. As the pair potential grows through the superconducting transition, each degenerate Landau level in the normal state splits into quasiparticle bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone. This brings Landau-level broadening, which in turn leads to the extra dHvA oscillation damping in the vortex state. We perform extensive numerical calculations for three-dimensional systems with various gap structures. It is thereby shown that (i) this Landau-level broadening is directly connected with the average gap at H=0 along each Fermi-surface orbit perpendicular to the field H, (ii) the extra dHvA oscillation attenuation is caused by the broadening around each extremal orbit. These results imply that the dHvA experiment can be a unique probe to detect band- and/or angle-dependent gap amplitudes. We derive an analytic expression for the extra damping based on the second-order perturbation with respect to the pair potential for the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic potential. This formula reproduces all our numerical results excellently, and is used to estimate band-specific gap amplitudes from available data on NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>, Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Sn, and YNi<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>2</SUB>C. The obtained value for YNi<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>2</SUB>C is fairly different from the one through a specific-heat measurement, indicating presence of gap anisotropy in this material.",
