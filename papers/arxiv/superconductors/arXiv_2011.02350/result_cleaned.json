Here, we report a microscopic investigation of the superconducting ground state in A15 compound Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) by muon spectroscopy measurements. Zero field muon measurements have shown that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in these materials. Furthermore, specific heat and a transverse field muon spectroscopy measurement rule out any possibility to have a nodal or anisotropic superconducting gap, revealing a conventional s-wave nature in the superconducting ground state. This work classifies A15 compound Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) as a time-reversal preserved topological superconductor.\n\n#### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nSpin-orbit coupling induced topological insulators (TI) are exceptional due to their unique property and incredible fundamental and applications-based intrigue. [\\[1\\]](#page-5-0). Moreover, topological superconductors (TSC) featuring fully gapped bulk and gapless surface states have added to this search of new materials [\\[2,](#page-5-1) [3\\]](#page-5-2). Theoretical studies have proposed that topological superconductivity can be induced on a topological insulator surface in proximity to superconductors where the Dirac cone type surface states are forced to favor a p<sup>x</sup> +ip<sup>y</sup> pairing [\\[4,](#page-5-3) [5\\]](#page-5-4). Several attempts have been made to realize superconductivity in TIs either by heterostructure fabrication or carrier doped topological insulators like CuxBi2Se<sup>3</sup> where features suggesting the existence of Majorana excitations can be observed [\\[6\\]](#page-5-5). However, the possible complexity at the interfaces means extending the idea to search for conventional s-wave superconductors with topological surface states.\n\nRecent studies suggest that bulk superconductors can also possess a topologically nontrivial band structure [\\[7\\]](#page-5-6). One of the main features behind these systems nontrivial behavior is the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that is strong enough to invert the band structure and leads to complete spin-momentum locking in the surface state [\\[2\\]](#page-5-1). Among these, A15 superconductors, a well-known family of metal-based compounds, are promising candidates to realize topological superconductivity. Reports suggest, the standard crystal structure symmetry of A15 compounds, along with SOC, creates gapped crossing near the Fermi level. The unnoticed topological surface states near the Fermi surface of A15 compounds Ta3Sb, Ta3Sn, and Ta3Pb was unveiled in the recent theoretical calculation, indicating the potential candidacy to host topological superconductivity [\\[8,](#page-5-7) [9\\]](#page-5-8). The topological bulk band structures of these compounds can be characterized by nontrivial Z<sup>2</sup> invariants, with topological surface bands appear near the Fermi surface as dictated by the bulk boundary correspondence. Ta3Sb houses an eight-fold degenerate Dirac point close to the Fermi level at symmetry point [\\[8\\]](#page-5-7). The first principle report on nonmagnetic A15 superconductors with high SOC has shown giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivities due to its many gapped Dirac crossings resulting in giant spin Berry curvature and correspondingly enormous intrinsic spin Hall effect [\\[9\\]](#page-5-8). Interestingly, the giant spin Hall conductivity in these materials has shown potential application in fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Superconductivity in topological materials reported hosting various unconventional properties. For example, CuxBi2Se<sup>3</sup> shows odd pairing [\\[10\\]](#page-5-9), rotational symmetry breaking, time-reversal symmetry breaking and superconducting topological surface state was observed in SrxBi2Se<sup>3</sup> [\\[11,](#page-5-10) [12\\]](#page-5-11), and PbTaSe<sup>2</sup> [\\[14\\]](#page-5-12), respectively. Due to the limited number of topological superconducting materials, the pairing mechanism is not clearly understood. In this paper, we report detailed µSR investigation of the superconducting ground state of topological superconducting materials Ti3Ir and Ti3Sb coupled with bulk measurements magnetization, heat capacity, and resistivity.\n\nZero field muon spin rotation and relaxation measurement (µSR) is an excellent means to study unconventional superconductivity. Spin-relaxation experiments in zero field (ZF) can detect spontaneous magnetization that can be associated with spin-triplet superconductivity [\\[15–](#page-5-13)[19\\]](#page-5-14). Also, µSR can measure the field distribution across the sample and can give magnetic penetration depth to a high degree of accuracy.

EXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATION DETAILS\n\nThe compounds investigated were prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of Ti (99.99 %) powder and Ir (99.97 %) or Sb (99.9 %) pieces in a nominal ratio of 3:1 by standard arc melting method with negligible mass loss. The samples were flipped and remelted several times to improve the chemical homogeneity. Later, the compounds were annealed at 900◦C for one week. The phase purity and crystal structure of the prepared samples were examined by PANalytical X,pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K<sup>α</sup> radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Room temperature Rietveld refinement was performed using Full Prof Suite Software. We measured DC susceptibility by Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID MPMS, Quantum Design) under different applied fields to study the superconducting properties. Specific heat measurements were performed by the two tau time-relaxation method in zero field in the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.). We carried out the µSR measurements on both the samples at the MuSR instrument of the ISIS neutron and muon source in STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom. Zero-field muon spin relaxation (ZF-µSR) was performed in the temperature range 0.3 - 9 K, and the transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-µSR) measurements were performed well above the lower critical field HC1(0).\n\n#### III. RESULTS AND DICUSSION\n\n#### a. Sample characterization\n\nRoom temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the samples are indexed well by cubic Cr3Si-type structure with the space group Pm-3n (no. 223). The Rietveld refined powder XRD patterns of Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) are shown in (Fig. [1\\)](#page-1-0). We have summarized the lattice parameters in the Table [I,](#page-1-1) which is consistent with the previous report [\\[20,](#page-5-15) [21\\]](#page-5-16).\n\n#### b. Normal and Superconducting State properties\n\nWe performed magnetization measurements in both zero-field cooled (ZFCW) and field cooled (FC) orders with a low applied field of 10 mT. The ZFC and FC curves indicate the type-II nature of Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) with superconducting transition temperature, T<sup>C</sup> = 4.3 ± 0.1 K and 6.7 ± 0.1 K, respectively, as shown in (Fig. [2\\)](#page-1-2). This result is compatible with the earlier report [\\[22\\]](#page-5-17).\n\nTABLE I.

The lower critical field HC1(0) was calculated from the low field magnetization curves M(H) by fitting the data in accordance with Ginzburg-Landau (GL) Eq.[\\(1\\)](#page-1-3):\n\n<span id=\"page-1-3\"></span>\n$$H\\_{C1}(T) = H\\_{C1}(0)\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_C}\\right)^2\\right) \\tag{1}$$\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>FIG. 3. (a) Variation of Magnetic moments with external field at different temperature. (c) Temperature dependence of the lower critical field HC<sup>1</sup> was fitted using Ginzburg-Landau relation.\n\nThe calculated values of HC1(0) are 5.2 ± 0.1 mT and 29.2 ± 0.4 mT for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb respectively)(b). To calculate the second-order transition field HC2(0), magnetization as well as specific heat measurements were done in different applied magnetic fields up to 4.0 T, as shown in Fig. [4.](#page-2-1) We have estimated the value of upper critical field HC2(0) by using GL formula\n\n$$H\\_{C2}(T) = H\\_{C2}(0)\\frac{\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_C}\\right)^2\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_C}\\right)^2\\right)}\\tag{2}$$\n\nThe calculated values of HC2(0) are 9.6 ± 0.1 T for Ti3Ir and 4.7 ± 0.2 T for Ti3Sb. The Pauli limiting field within the BCS theory is expressed as H<sup>p</sup> C2 (0) = 1.83 T<sup>C</sup> , which gives H<sup>p</sup> C2 (0) = 7.9 ± 0.2 and 12.3 ± 0.3 T for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb respectively). It is very interesting that, HC2(0) has exceeded the Pauli limit in case of Ti3Ir, indicating a possible unconventional pairing.\n\nWe have calculated superconducting characteristics parameters, GL coherence length ξGL(0) and penetration depth λGL(0) by using the relations Eq. [\\(3\\)](#page-2-2), and Eq. [\\(4\\)](#page-2-3).\n\n<span id=\"page-2-2\"></span>\n$$H\\_{C2}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi\\_0}{2\\pi\\xi\\_{GL}^2} \\tag{3}$$\n\n<span id=\"page-2-3\"></span>\n$$H\\_{C1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi\\_0}{4\\pi\\lambda\\_{GL}^2(0)} \\left( \\ln \\frac{\\lambda\\_{GL}(0)}{\\xi\\_{GL}(0)} + 0.497 \\right) \\tag{4}$$\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>FIG. 4.

HC2(0) was calculated via GL- formula.\n\nwhere Φ<sup>0</sup> (= 2.07 ×10−<sup>15</sup> T m<sup>2</sup> ) is the magnetic flux quantum [\\[23\\]](#page-5-18). The estimated values of ξGL(0) and λGL(0) were 58.6 ± 0.5 Å and 3851 ± 8 Å for Ti3Ir and 83.9 ± 0.3 Å and 1361 ± 3 Å for Ti3Sb. The value of GL parameter defined as kGL = λGL(0) <sup>ξ</sup>GL(0) = 65.7 ± 0.1 and 16.2 ± 0.2 for Ti3X (X =Ir, Sb) indicate the compounds as strong type-II superconductor. Thermodynamic critical field H<sup>C</sup> is estimated around 0.11 ± 0.02 T and 0.22 ± 0.03 T for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) from the relation HC1(0)HC2(0) = H<sup>2</sup> <sup>C</sup> lnkGL.\n\nThe samples were further characterized by heat capacity measurements at zero fields. A pronounced jump in heat capacity data indicates the superconducting transition, as observed in Fig. [5.](#page-2-4) To analyze the phonon properties and electronic density of states of the samples, we fitted the normal-state specific heat data by using the relation <sup>C</sup> <sup>T</sup> = γ<sup>n</sup> + βT<sup>2</sup> where γ<sup>n</sup> is Sommerfeld coefficient and β is Debye constant. The extrapolation of normal state behavior to the T → 0 limits allows the determination of normal state coefficients as γ<sup>n</sup> = 22.5 ± 0.1 mJ/mol K and β= 0.57 ± 0.02 mJ/mol K<sup>2</sup> for Ti3Ir and γ<sup>n</sup> = 49.2 ± 0.3 mJ/mol K and β= 0.49 ± 0.03 mJ/mol K<sup>2</sup> for Ti3Sb.\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_13.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-2-4\"></span>FIG. 5. The variation of C/T with T<sup>2</sup> in zero fields where the pronounced jump indicate the superconducting transition. The dotted line is the fit in the normal state.\n\nAccording to the Debye model Debye temperature θ<sup>D</sup> is correlated to β by the relation θ<sup>D</sup> = 12π <sup>4</sup>RN 5β 1 3 where N (= 4) is the number of atoms per formula unit, R is the molar gas constant (= 8.314 J mol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> K<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ). The evaluated θ<sup>D</sup> value was 239 ± 1 K and 25 ± 1 K for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb). We have used the value of γ<sup>n</sup> to extract the density of states D<sup>C</sup> (E<sup>F</sup> ) at the Fermi level from the relation γ<sup>n</sup> = π 2k 2 B 3 D<sup>C</sup> (E<sup>f</sup> ), where k<sup>B</sup> ' 1.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>23</sup> J K<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The approximated values are 9.5 ± 0.2 and 20.9 ± 0.1 states eV f.u for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb respectively). McMillan equation, λe−ph = 1.04+µ ∗ ln(θD/1.45T<sup>C</sup> ) (1−0.62µ∗)ln(θD/1.45T<sup>C</sup> )−1.04 was used to calculate the strength of the attractive interaction between electron and phonon (λe−ph) [\\[26\\]](#page-5-19). The calculated values of λe−ph = 0.65 ± 0.02 for Ti3Ir and 0.74 ± 0.01 for Ti3Sb suggesting that Ti3X is a moderately coupled superconductor similar to Re6X (X = Zr, Hf) [\\[25,](#page-5-20) [27\\]](#page-5-21). To find the behavior of the superconducting\n\nground state, electronic specific heat was extracted from total specific heat data by the relation Cel = C − β3T 3 . The data was well fitted with the BCS theory (Fig. [6\\)](#page-3-0) [\\[28\\]](#page-5-22). This yielded the value of the superconducting energy gap as ∆(0) kBT<sup>C</sup> = 1.78 ± 0.04 for Ti3Ir and 1.90 ± 0.03 for Ti3Sb which is close to the BCS predicted value.\n\nSpecific heat measurements was performed at different applied field to determine the field dependence of Sommerfeld coefficient, γ(H) using the relation Cel/T versus T data with the equation <sup>C</sup>el <sup>T</sup> = γ + A T exp <sup>−</sup>bT<sup>C</sup> T [\\[29\\]](#page-5-23). Field dependence of Sommerfeld coefficient γ is shown in Fig. [6\\(](#page-3-0)b), where γ and H are normalized by γ<sup>n</sup> and HC2(0), respectively. Here we can observe γ increases linearly with H in the lower field region as shown in the Fig. [6\\(](#page-3-0)b) indicating fully gapped superconducting energy gap.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>FIG. 6. (a) The specific-heat data in superconducting region fitted for single-gap s-wave model. (b) γ and H were plotted versus each other after normalizing by γ<sup>n</sup> and HC2(0) and fitted with straight line.\n\nWe have further studied Ti3X compound by muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements to explore the nature of the superconducting gap and symmetry of the order parameter. TF-µSR measurements were done in a field-cooled mode (30 mT) down to 0.28 K for Ti3Ir and 0.4 K for Ti3Sb. TF-µSR precessional signals of both the samples at temperatures above and below T<sup>C</sup> is shown in Fig. [7.](#page-3-1) The normal state data shows a homogeneous field distribution throughout the time scale evident from the signal's non-decaying nature, whereas the superconducting state shows a decaying signal due to nonuniform field distribution in the flux line lattice (FLL) state. The timedomain signals were best fitted by the decaying Gaussian oscillatory function.\n\n$$G\\_{\\rm TF}(t) = A\\_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\sigma^2 t^2}{2}\\right) \\cos(\\gamma\\_\\mu B t + \\phi)$$\n\n$$+ A\\_{bg} \\cos(\\gamma\\_\\mu B\\_{bg} t + \\phi) \\tag{5}$$\n\nwhere φ is the initial phase of the muon spin polarization with respect to detector, A<sup>1</sup> is the asymmetry, B is meanfield of the Gaussian distribution, σ is relaxation rate, and γµ/2π = 135.5 MHz/T is muon gyromagnetic ratio. An additional oscillatory term consists of the asymmetry Abg, and the field Bbg were also added to compensate for the background contribution.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>FIG. 7. TF-µSR spectra above and below T<sup>C</sup> at 30 mT is shown in (a) for Ti3Ir and in (b) for Ti3Sb. The spectra below T<sup>C</sup> decays faster for both samples indicating vortex formation. (c) and (d) The variation of depolarisation across flux line lattice. The solid line is the fit to s-wave model in dirty limit.\n\nσ is the total depolarization arising due to the field variation across the flux line lattice σsc, and the nuclear dipolar moments, σN. We have extracted σsc by the relation σ <sup>2</sup> = σ 2 sc+σ 2 <sup>N</sup>. The variation of σsc with temperature was calculated by the second-moment method Fig. [7](#page-3-1) (c) and (d). It is clearly seen that below ' Tc/3, the temperature dependence of σsc is seen nearly constant for both the compound. This indicates the absence of nodes in the energy gap at the Fermi surface. We have fitted the data in the dirty limit within the local London approximation for a BCS superconductor. The corresponding expression is given by the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\sigma\\_{sc}^{-2}(T)}{\\sigma\\_{sc}^{-2}(0)} = \\frac{\\Delta(T)}{\\Delta(0)} \\tanh\\left[\\frac{\\Delta(T)}{2k\\_B T}\\right],\\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere ∆(0) is the energy gap magnitude at zero temperature and ∆(T)/∆(0) = tanh{1.82(1.018(Tc/T −1))<sup>0</sup>.<sup>51</sup>} is the BCS approximation for the temperature variation of the energy gap. The fit yields ∆<sup>0</sup> = 0.53 ± 0.01 meV and 1.10 ± 0.06 meV for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb respectively). The calculated value of normalised superconducting energy gap ∆(0) kBT<sup>c</sup> is 1.54 ± 0.02 for Ti3Ir and 1.90 ± 0.02 for Ti3Sb, whereas the BCS predicted value is 1.76.\n\nWe have calculated the London penetration depth λ(0) = 2630 ± 20 Å and 1845 ± 15 Å for Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb respectively) by the relation\n\n$$\\frac{\\sigma\\_{sc}^{-2}(0)}{\\gamma\\_{\\mu}^{2}} = 0.00371 \\ast \\frac{\\phi\\_0^2}{\\lambda^4(0)}\\tag{7}$$\n\nThese values are consistent with magnetization measurements. The ratio <sup>T</sup><sup>C</sup> <sup>λ</sup>−2(0) is estimated as 0.30 ± 0.02 for Ti3Ir and 0.22 ± 0.02 for Ti3Sb which is ten times greater than the BCS limit 0.00025 ∼ 0.015 [\\[30,](#page-5-24) [31\\]](#page-5-25).\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG. 8. ZF-µSR spectra above and below T<sup>C</sup> (a) Ti3Ir and (b) Ti3Sb. The solid line is the fit to static Kubo Toyabe exponential times decay function.\n\nThe measured ZF-µSR spectra below and above spectra are shown in Fig. [8.](#page-4-0) The asymmetry spectra were best fitted by static Kubo Toyabe function multiplied by an exponential decay [\\[32\\]](#page-5-26). There is no change in asymmetry spectra for the samples at temperatures above and below the superconducting transition. This suggests the absence of a spontaneous magnetic field below the superconducting transition temperature. This clearly indicates that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in both the samples within the detection limit of µSR. Hence this work upholds the A15 compounds into time reversal symmetry preserved topological superconductors similar to rocksalt carbides NbC and TaC [\\[33\\]](#page-5-27). We have calculated the Fermi temperature (T<sup>F</sup> ) for the samples in the dirty limit by simultaneously solving a set of five equations. A summary of the estimated parameters of both compounds is given in Table [II.](#page-4-1) According to Uemura Classification scheme [\\[30,](#page-5-24) [31,](#page-5-25) [34,](#page-5-28) [35\\]](#page-5-29), the ratio <sup>T</sup><sup>C</sup> T<sup>F</sup> for unconventional superconductors falls in the range 0.01≤ T<sup>c</sup> T<sup>F</sup> ≤0.1, while for conventional superconductors, <sup>T</sup><sup>c</sup> T<sup>F</sup> ≤ 0.001. The estimated values of T<sup>F</sup> are 1399 ± 33 K and 994 ± 17 K, which gives the ratio <sup>T</sup><sup>C</sup> T<sup>F</sup> as 0.003 for Ti3Ir and 0.0055 for Ti3Sb places the compounds out of the band of an unconventional family but close to many other exotic superconductors [\\[27,](#page-5-21) [36–](#page-5-30)[43\\]](#page-5-31) (Fig. [9\\)](#page-4-2).\n\n#### IV.

Samples were in pure phase with no impurity peak. Magnetization measurements suggest both the compounds are type-II superconductors with transition temperatures 4.3 K and 6.7 K, respectively.

However, TF-µSR confirms the fully gaped superconducting order parameter in both the compounds. ZF-µSR measurements reveal that the timereversal symmetry is preserved within the detection limit of µSR, categorizing these compounds into time reversal symmetry preserved topological superconducting candidates. To understand the role of the nontrivial band topology/topological surface states on the superconducting ground state, it is vital to study more A15 superconductors.\n\n### V. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nR.

The superconducting ground state of the A15 alloys Ti<SUB>3</SUB>X (X =Ir ,Sb ), by muon spectroscopy, has been investigated. Zero-field muon spin relaxation measurements have shown that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in these materials. Furthermore, specific-heat and transverse-field muon rotation measurements rule out any possibility of a nodal or anisotropic superconducting gap but reveal a conventional isotropic s -wave gap structure. This supports the idea that these A15 superconductors are time-reversal-symmetry-preserved topological superconducting candidate compounds.",
