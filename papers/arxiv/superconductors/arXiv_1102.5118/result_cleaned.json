Lee, David C. Larbalestier\n\n*National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32310, USA \\*Now at Department of Physics, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701 South Korea* \n\n## **Abstract:**\n\nAlthough 2011 marks the 50th anniversary of Nb3Sn as the first high field superconductor, real understanding of its upper critical field behavior *µ0Hc2* is incomplete. Here we show surprising *µ0Hc2* data on highly homogeneous bulk samples examined both by small-current, transport and by volumetric-averaging specific heat and the reversible magnetization techniques, which exhibit identical upper critical field *µ0Hc2(0.3 K)* ~ 29± 0.2 T with or without undergoing the cubic to tetragonal transition, a result in strong contrast to widely used multiple-source data compilations that show a strong depression of *µ0Hc2(0K)* from 29 T to 21.4 T in the tetragonal state.\n\nNb3Sn is the most widely used superconductor for generating fields above ~10 T because it is easily and economically fabricated in round-wire, multifilament forms that lend themselves both to laboratory magnets and to the cabled, high-current conductors needed for accelerator and fusion uses. More than 600 tons of Nb3Sn will be used in the International Tokomak Experimental Reactor (ITER). This wide and long-standing use [1] makes it all the more surprising that there is no agreed data set that shows the variation of the upper critical field *µ0Hc2* across the variable composition of the A15 phase of Nb3Sn. High Sn compositions are important for the very high critical current densities *Jc* now achieved in commercial strands.[2] Optimizing *Jc*(*H*) would be much easier with a quantitative understanding of how *µ0Hc2* varies with Sn content since all practical Nb3Sn wire forms contain the full range of A15\n\nphase compositions (generally thought to range from ~18-25 at% Sn [3]). The integrated effect of shells of varying composition and thus *Tc* and *Hc2* has been addressed both experimentally [4] and by modeling [5]. These studies show that flattening the Sn gradient raises the effective μ0*Hc2* and *Jc*. The modeling scheme of Cooley *et al.* [5] is particularly valuable, but it lacks key information, namely the composition dependence of *µ0Hc2*. To remedy this lack, we have fabricated homogeneous binary Nb3Sn bulk samples to provide the compositional variation of *µ0Hc2* with one sample set made in one, consistent fashion. Here we show whether the sample transforms to the tetragonal state or not is irrelevant to *µ0Hc2(0)*, which can equal 29.1 ± 0.2 T in both cases, values as high as any optimally Tior Ta-doped wire [4] [6].\n\nRather homogeneous bulk Nb3Sn was made by Devantay *et al.* [7] by heating samples into the melt phase and by Goldacker *et al.* [8] in a Hot Isostatic Press (HIP) at 1100 ºC. To further reduce inhomogeneity, we used a HIP capable of reaching up to 2200 °C. Here we report on bulk Nb3Sn with nominally stoichiometric 25at% Sn and Sn-rich 27at% Sn so as to ensure the most Sn-rich composition of the A15 phase. About 45 g samples were synthesized by combining Nb (-325 mesh, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar) and Sn (-325 mesh, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar) powders in a high energy ball mill. Mixing and powder packing was performed in a dedicated glove box filled with Ar gas to minimize oxidation. After 60 minutes of ball milling, the mixed powders were pressed in a Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) to form a hard pellet, then wrapped in Ta foil and put into a steel tube with one closed end. This HIP tube was then evacuated and the open end sealed by welding. The sealed can was pressurized at 2 kbar during both a pre-anneal at 650 °C for 16 hr and during the main A15 phase reaction at 1200 °C for 72 or 160 hr. The central reacted A15 part of each of the cans was cut into 2 pieces using a precision diamond saw, one piece being then re-sealed in an evacuated Ta-lined Nb tube for a 2nd HIP homogenization and reaction-continuation anneal at 1400 °C, 1600 °C or 1800 °C for 24 hr. One piece of the 27 at% Sn\n\nsample annealed at 1800o C was further annealed in a Ta-lined Nb tube for 30 days at 1200 °C. In this report we describe samples by their nominal or overall atomic %Sn content, followed by the final heat treatment and time (if not specified, 24 hr). For example, 25Sn\\_1800 means the sample finally annealed at 1800 °C for 24 hr after pre-annealing at 650 °C for 16 hr and reaction at 1200 °C for 72 hr. However, we also report the measured compositions of the A15 grains in each sample when considering the final properties.\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to measure lattice parameters and search for the tetragonal transformation in an instrument equipped with a helium cryostat. Specific heat measurements of the *T*<sup>c</sup> distribution were performed in a 16 T Physical Property Measurement Systems (PPMS). *H*c2*(T)* was mostly determined by small-current resistivity measurements in fields up to 32 T down to 0.3 K but was benchmarked in several cases by measurements of *µ0Hc2* derived from the reversible magnetization in a 14 T vibrating sample magnetometer. The samples were so well annealed that they showed very little magnetization hysteresis and clear *Hc2* transitions. A15 grain compositions were determined using pure-element-standardized energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in a field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).\n\nFig. 1 shows the resistive and specific heat superconducting transitions and the calculated *T*<sup>c</sup> distributions [9] [10] for both compositions in their differently heat treated conditions. Table 1 summarizes the *Tc*, lattice parameters a0, the EDS-measured Sn at%, the Residual Resistance Ratio (RRR) [=ρ(300 K)/ ρ(20 K)], ρ(20 K) and the resistively measured μ*oHc2* at 0.3 K. Raising the annealing temperature to 1800 ºC reduces the A15 Sn content by about 1at.% in each case, but *T*c drops only slightly on raising the annealing temperature from 1400 °C to 1800 °C. All the data indicate that\n\n3\n\nSn is rejected from the A15 lattice above 1400 °C, consistent with the Nb3Sn phase boundary bending to Sn-poor compositions as in published Nb-Sn phase diagrams [3, 11]. High sample homogeneity is attested by narrow resistivity transitions (except for the 27Sn\\_1400 sample) and especially by the narrow specific heat *T*c distributions of Fig 1. Moreover, high homogeneity is also evidenced by the fact that the volumetric averaging measurement of the reversible magnetization yields sharp magnetization slope transitions at *Hc2(T)* which overlap very closely with the potentially percolative, \"best bit\" resistivity measurements (Fig. 2). We thus have good confidence that the μ*0Hc2(T)* values from our high-field resistivity measurements represent the entire sample, except in the one sample 27Sn\\_1400 shown in Fig. 1.\n\nThe cubic to tetragonal structural transformation of the A15 phase has been reported to occur at temperatures varying from 31 K to 45 K [12]. For example, the tetragonal transformation takes place below 45 K in the study of Devantay *et al.* [7] and at 35 K in the samples of Goldacker *et al.* [8], when Sn is >24.5% [8]. Fig. 3 shows the {400} XRD peaks obtained at room temperature and at 10 K for both compositions in various conditions. The split of the 2θ peak around 71.4° at room temperature into two peaks at 10 K is clear evidence of the cubic to tetragonal transformation. The contraction along the c-axis distinguishes the (004) plane reflection from the {400} family and moves it to a higher angle. While 25Sn\\_1400, 25Sn\\_1600, 27Sn\\_1400, and 27Sn\\_1200\\_30days display the tetragonal structure in Fig. 3, 25Sn\\_1800 and 27Sn\\_1800 remain cubic down to 10 K. The EDS-measured Sn contents of our tetragonal samples are 24.6% (\"25Sn\\_1400\"), 24.5% (\"25Sn\\_1600\"), 24.6% (\"27Sn\\_1400\"), and 24.7% (\"27Sn\\_1200\"), respectively, while those of the cubic samples are 23.3% (\"25Sn\\_1800\") and 23.7% (\"27Sn\\_1800\"). This result does conform that the cubic to tetragonal transformation occurs only for Sn higher than 24.5%Sn [7] [8] [13].\n\n4\n\nFig. 4 (a) shows *µ0H*c2 *(T)* of 25Sn\\_1400, 25Sn\\_1800, 27Sn\\_1400, and 27Sn\\_1800, comparing both tetragonal (solid symbols) and cubic samples (open symbols). They have identical *µ0Hc2(T)* behavior with *µ0Hc2(0.3K)* = 29.1 ± 0.2 T. This result strongly contrasts with the widely reported depression of *µ0Hc2(T)* for tetragonal Nb3Sn [13] [14] [15], as is shown in the comparisons of Fig. 4(b) and (c). These new samples of known, high homogeneity show for the first time that the cubic-tetragonal transformation does not control *Hc2*. Also of note is that the *µ0Hc2(T)* of our bulk Nb3Sn is significantly higher than most previous reports [13][14] [15], with the exception of Foner's [14] cubic single crystals. In fact the literature finding that tetragonal Nb3Sn shows a significant depression of *µ0Hc2 (T)* comes from a sister crystal without chemical characterization [15].\n\nThere remains the issue of the normal state resistivity dependence of *µ0Hc2*. Orlando *et al* [15] noticed a crossover in on going from a \"clean\" film with ρ = 8.8 μΩ−cm (RRR~9.5) to a rather \"dirty\" sample with ρ = 36 μΩ−cm), μ*0Hc2(0)* rising from ~26.5 to 29 T. Table I similarly divides our samples into a \"cleaner\" group with resistivities around ρ~10 μΩ−cm and \"dirtier\" samples with ρ>20 μΩ−cm. Fig. 5(a) shows that the \"cleaner\" samples have a lower μ*0Hc2(0.3 K)* ~27 T. Fig. 5(b) shows that μ*0Hc2* and A15 phase Sn content % are much less well correlated, since samples with Sn contents of 23.3 and 24.6at.%Sn both have μ*0Hc2(0.3K)* > 29T. This result is in agreement with the expectations of standard GLAG expressions for *Hc2* as shown in Orlando *et al.* [16].\n\nThe conventional view that *µ0Hc2* is suppressed in the tetragonal state and speculations that this may explain some of the strong reversible strain sensitivity of the superconducting properties [17,18] has been derived from compilations of limited *µ0Hc2* data taken on a wide variety of samples fabricated in\n\ndifferent ways and of various material forms (thin films, single crystals and polycrystals). By contrast here we have varied the Sn% while maintaining the same sample quality, form and fabrication method. Multiple measurement types have directly addressed our sample homogeneity issue, leading us to conclude that all except one sample (27Sn\\_1400 – see Fig. 1) are indeed very homogeneous. We also found that our highest *µ0Hc2* (0.3 K) values of 29.1± 0.2 T agree well with the highest previous measured *µ0Hc2* values [16, 18]. We conclude that the previously reported low values of µ0*H*c2 (0) ~21.4 T for tetragonal Nb3Sn [13] [14] [15] are not determined by whether they undergo the cubic to tetragonal transformation or not. Finally we note that Cooley *et al.* [20] have shown that ball milling followed by low temperature reactions (~650<sup>o</sup> C) can strongly increase the *µ0Hc2(T)* slope at *T*c. Based on standard Werthamer, Helfand and Hohenberg (WHH) fitting to *µ0Hc2* of data up to 9 T, they deduced that *µ0Hc2(0)* could reach 35 T. However, to make our ball-milled samples homogeneous, we had to take our samples to temperatures well above 1200˚C where this valuable milling disorder anneals away. But in search of the maximum critical field, we may note the surprising result from the present binary samples is that *µ0Hc2(0)* = 29 T is as high as any optimized Ta- or Ti-doped wire, suggesting that wires do not yet have the optimum *µ0Hc2* possible in the system.\n\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Awards No. DE-FG02-06ER54881 and DE-FG02-07ER41451.
