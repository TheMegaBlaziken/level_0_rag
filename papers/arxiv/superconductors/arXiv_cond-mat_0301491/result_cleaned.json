T he param eters ofthe theory are pressure as wellas tem perature dependent. N ew pressure eects em erge as a result of the com petition between the two bands. T he theory then is applied to M gB2. W e identify two possible scenaria regarding the fate ofthe two subbands under pressure,depending on w hether or not both subbands are above the Ferm ienergy at am bient pressure. T he splitting ofthe two subbandsis probably caused by the E <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> distortion.

In the second scenario both bands start above the Ferm i energy and they m ove below it, either by pressure or via the substitution of M g by A l.

In the case of M gB2 we can safely consider that >\n\n#### III. NONAD IABATIC EFFECTS\n\nW e now wish to address an issue speci c to M gB 2 which can be also realized in other multiband superconductors. The physical situation we would like to question is the splitting of the tw o subbands at am bient pressure and their participation in superconductivity with the increase of pressure. Due to contradictory experim ental as well as theoretical results we proceed by distinguishing two di erent scenaria. The rst one addresses the splitting of the two sigm a subbands at am bient pressure as shown by rst princible calculations [9,10,37]when one of the subbands is below the Ferm ienergy E p . The second scenario addresses the opposite situation where both the\n\nsubbands are above Ep at am bient pressure.\n\nA . Scenario I : one sub-band above EF at am bient p ressure.\n\nIn particular in [37] the splitting of the two subbands w as studied in detailand com pared with sim ilar situation in A B2. The conclusion is that due to the E2q phonon m ode, the two bands split nearby point and the low er band completely sinks below the Ferm i energy. This is the case for M gB 2 and also for the heavily hole doped graphite. M oreover, experim ental results [33,38] show ed a kink in the superconducting critical tem perature as a function of pressure at approxim ately 6-8 G P a and also a kink in the volume dependence of To for M g10B2 at around 20 G P a and M g 1 B 2 at around 15 G P a [7].\n\nThe physics we discuss here, is the change in the electronic properties of the m aterial under pressure and its in uence on the superconducting state. The band which is below the Ferm i level at am bient pressure [9] is possible to overcom e the energy di erence and to get above the Ferm i levelat a certain value of pressure (term ed as crossover pressure), restoring the degeneracy of the two\n\nbands at point . This is a non-adiabatic e ect as discussed in [37]. To understand and illustrate this e ect on the superconducting state we need to consider the pressure dependence of the coe cient as usual [39] w ith\n\nthe m odi cation due to the particular physical situation by w riting:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{ccccccccc} & & & & \\mathbf{(}\\_{\\odot}\\mathbf{q} & \\mathbf{\\not\\in p} & \\mathbf{(}\\_{\\odot}\\mathbf{q} & \\mathbf{\\not\\in q} & + & \\mathbf{\\not\\in p} & \\mathbf{T} & \\mathbf{T} & \\mathbf{D} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ & & & & & & \\mathbf{(}\\_{\\odot}\\mathbf{q} & + & \\mathbf{D} & \\mathbf{T} & \\mathbf{D} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{5}$$\n\nwhere (x) is the H eaviside step function, and 1 are positive constants. This choice re ects the fact that at a certain crossover pressure pc the second band starts to participate in superconductivity as well and that initially it is an increasing function of pressure. We obtained the above form ula by requiring the continuity of the coe cient at pc .\n\nAfter the energy di erence between the two bands alm ost disappears, then they both follow the sam e reduction of the bare T 。's with pressure. The approxim ate value of the crossover pressure can be estim ated as follow s. The energy di exence between the two subbands is\napproxim ated by E. ' (1 m) of superconducting electrons is 1 carrier density per boron atom in M gB 2. The approxim ate value of p 。 is half the value of the pressure which suppresses the deform ation potential . The deform ation potential in turn, can be estim ated by the expression (1 \nof M gB 2 and == 0:04eV 2 is the deform ation potential for a boron displacem ent u 0:03A [10]. U sing these param eters, we get a crossover pressure of p. 15G P a. This estim ate show s, that a realistic applied pressure inuences drastically the electronic structure and the FS topology, restoring the degeneracy of the two subbands at the point which are initially splitted. Superconductivity in the second subband may occur at lower values of the estim ated p due to the fact that both subbands are a ected. The elim ination of the energy di erence around the Ferm i energy will also occur at lower values due to the corrugation of the portions of the F S, the already existing strains in the m aterial and the an isotropic com pressibility. These considerations m ake the above estim ate an upper lim it of the crossover pressure pc. The degree to which shear stresses of the sam ple and the surrounding uid under pressure a ect the data of pressure m easurem ents is still under investigation [19].\n\nThe m icroscopic nature of this crossover is caused by the change of the FS. If the topology of the F'S changes under pressure (this subsection) or due to substitutions in the com position (next subsection), a van Hove singularity at critical energy E c in the electronic density of states (E ) is m anifested in an electronic topological transition of the 5/2 kind [40]. Since dT 。= dp is essentially proportional to the derivative d (Er )=dEF , it develops singularities / 1= Ep E c, provided that the strength of carrier attraction varies slightly w ith pressure [41].\n\nIn Fig. 1 using a model calculation, we illustrate the expected behavior ofTc and the form of the order param eter as a finction of pressure at xed tem perature and,\n\nschem atically,thekink ofT<sup>c</sup> atp<sup>c</sup> dueto thechangeofthe slopefrom Eq.(5).T hepredicted kink closeto p<sup>c</sup> can be detected directly in a penetration depth experim ent under pressure. T he chosen param eters are such that they respectthe relation > ,the factthat the superconducting density com ing from the band is higher than the one com ing from the band ( > )and thatthe driving band for superconductivity is (T <sup>0</sup> > T<sup>0</sup>).\n\nT he contribution on the G runeisen param eter:\n\n$$\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{B} \\frac{\\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{h} \\mathbf{l}}{\\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{p}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mathbf{l}} \\frac{\\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{l}}{\\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{p}} ; \\tag{6}$$\n\nw here B is the bulk m odulus and ! is the phonon frequency, can be approxim ately obtained if we observe that E ' ~!<sup>E</sup> <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> then G ' B =2pc.

The parameters of the theory are pressure as well as temperature dependent. New pressure effects emerge as a result of the competition between the two bands. The theory then is applied to MgB<SUB>2</SUB>. We identify two possible scenaria regarding the fate of the two σ subbands under pressure, depending on whether or not both subbands are above the Fermi energy at ambient pressure. The splitting of the two subbands is probably caused by the E<SUB>2g</SUB> distortion. If only one subband is above the Fermi energy at ambient pressure (scenario I), application of pressure diminishes the splitting and it is possible that the lower subband participates in the superconductivity. The corresponding crossover pressure and Gr neisen parameter are estimated. In the second scenario both bands start above the Fermi energy and they move below it, either by pressure or via the substitution of Mg by Al. In both scenaria, the possibility of electronical topological transition is emphasized. Experimental signatures of both scenaria are presented and existing experiments are discussed in the light of the different physical pictures.",
