Miheev Institute of Metal Physics, Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, 18, S. Kovalevskoy St., Ekaterinburg 620108, Russia* \n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThe discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S and H3P), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6, and other). In these classes, the hydrogen ions form three-dimensional sub-lattices involving the dissociation of hydrogen molecules (where, the H-H distance is 74 pm) into a metallic state with the shortest H-H distance of 151 pm in H3S and 115 pm in LaH10. Recently, the third class of highly compressed superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by two superhydrides, BaH12 and BiH4, which both exhibit the smallest H-H distance of 81 pm in the pressure ranges where the highest *T*c is achieved. Here, we analyzed the available experimental data for the molecular hydrides BaH12 and BiH4. We found that BaH12 exhibits nanosized grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain of 0.1%, both of which are independent of pressure in the range of 126 ൏ ൏ 160 . We also derived the Debye Θ and Einstein Θா temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant ି, in BaH12 and BiH4. The latter differs from the values obtained by firstprinciples calculations. The derived Fermi temperature ி ≅ 20,000 for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the\n\nUemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio Θ⁄ி ൌ 0.026 of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.\n\n# **The compliance of the molecular hydride superconductor BiH4 with the Migdal's theorem I. Introduction.**\n\nThe discovery of a superconducting state in pressurized H3S <sup>1</sup> with a transition temperature ൌ 203 represented the triumph of modern experimental and theoretical physics. During the decade following this discovery, about six hundreds of new hydride phases were discovered during experimental quests and first-principles calculations 2–35. The current progress in the field has been reviewed 36–41. During the last decade, several important questions on fundamental properties of highly compressed and ambient pressure superconductors have been discussed 42–53.\n\nThere are two dominant classes of superhydrides that are primarily studied. The first class is the compounds with covalently bonded hydrogen. Historically, this class of high-*T*c hydrides was first discovered experimentally 54,55.\n\nThe second class is the clathrate hydrides, where there are several sign superconducting phases, for instance, LaH10 4–6,56, YH6 8,56,57, CaH6 58,59, and some ternary and quarterly hydrides.\n\nHowever, both of these classes of hydrides share a common feature - a three-dimensional sublattice formed by dissociated hydrogen ions, which implies that the molecular form of hydrogen in these compounds has dissociated. While hydrogen molecules have an H–H distance of 74 pm, these three-dimensional metallic conducting sublattices in covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides exhibit much larger H–H distance (151 pm in H3S and 115 pm in LaH10. 60).\n\nIt should be noted, that the hydrogen in metals is the topic for studies for more than 150 years 61, about a hundred years ago, it was found that atomic hydrogen does not react with pure bismuth 62. Despite a fact that the electronegativity χ (and, thus, chemical properties) of the metals at high pressure are radically different from the ones at normal conditions 63 (for instance, elemental bismuth is changing its electronegativity from ሺ ൌ 0 ሻ ൌ 1.2 to\n\nሺ ൌ 200 ሻ ൌ െ5.2 63) we should not exclude that atomic hydrogen can occupy some interstitial sites in the crystal lattice at high pressures, similar to the occupation of interstitial sites in alloys 64 at ambient pressure. Hydrogen atoms vibrate mainly with localized (optical) modes at their interstitial sites 65, and, in addition, at the modes associated with strongly distorted (by the presence of the hydrogen) lattice vibrations (which are short-wavelength acoustic modes of the distorted lattice 65). All mentioned above reasons cause the change in the phonon spectrum, and as a consequence of it, the electron-phonon coupling constant ି might also enhance.\n\nFrom other hand, theoretical studies, including first-principles calculations (fpc), have predicted 66,67 that to achieve metallic conductivity and a superconducting state at liquid nitrogen temperatures in compressed hydrogen, the formation of a sublattice of dissociated molecular hydrogen is not strictly necessary.\n\nAnd recently, a third class of highly compressed superconducting hydrides has been experimentally discovered, in which hydrogen retains its molecular form but exhibits metallization when compressed in the megabar range 68,69. This class is currently represented by two superhydrides, BaH12 and BiH4, which both exhibit the smallest H-H distance of 81 pm in the pressure ranges 69, where the highest *T*c is achieved for each compound.\n\nThe first-principles study of the phase diagram and superconductivity in Bi-H system was performed by Ma *et al* 70 in 2015. And to the best of our knowledge Shan *et al.*69 performed first experimental study of this system.\n\nHere we have analysed the currently available experimental data for the BaH12 68 and BiH4 <sup>69</sup> molecular hydrides.\n\n#### **II. Utilized models**\n\nThere is no direct microscopy with submicron resolution, which can be used to reveal structural parameters of highly compressed materials in the diamond anvil cell (DAC). In attempt to resolve this problem, in 71,72 we proposed to use the Williamson-Hall (WH) analysis73 of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data:\n\n$$\\beta(\\theta, P) = \\frac{k\\_{\\text{s}} \\times \\lambda\\_{\\text{X-ray}}}{\\text{D}(\\theta) \\times \\cos(\\theta)} + 4 \\times \\varepsilon(P) \\times \\tan(\\theta), \\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere ሺ, ሻ is integral breadth of the peak in experimental XRD scan, ௦ is the Scherrer constant usually assigned as 0.9 74–77, ି௬ is the wavelength of the radiation, ሺሻ is the mean size of coherent scattering regions, and the ሺሻ is the mean microstrain in crystalline lattice. Experimental XRD scans for BaH12 hydride were kindly provided by the authors 68. We processed these datasets by the DIOPTAS software 78.\n\nOne of the primary parameters of any electron-phonon superconductors is the Debye temperature Θ which can be deduced from the fit of measured thermal dependence of normal state resistance ሺሻ to the Bloch- Grüneisen (BG) equation 79,80:\n\n$$R(T) = R\\_0 + A \\left(\\frac{T}{\\theta\\_\\mathcal{D}}\\right)^5 \\int\\_0^{\\frac{\\theta\\_\\mathcal{D}}{T}} \\frac{x^5}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})} dx\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere where , , and Θ are free-fitting parameters. Deduced Θ and measured in experiment can be used to deduce the electron-phonon coupling constant ି as a root of the system of McMillan equations 81,82 :\n\n$$T\\_c = \\frac{\\Theta\\_D}{1.4} e^{\\left[\\frac{1.04\\left(1+\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}-\\mu^\\*\\left(1+0.62\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}\\right]} \\cdot f\\_1 \\cdot f\\_2^\\* \\tag{3}$$\n\n$$f\\_1 = \\left( 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}}{2.46(1 + 3.8\\mu^\\*)} \\right)^{3/2} \\right)^{1/3} \\tag{4}$$\n\n$$f\\_2^\\* = 1 + \\{0.0241 - 0.0735 \\cdot \\mu^\\*\\} \\cdot \\lambda\\_{e-ph}^2 \\tag{5}$$\n\nwhere ∗ is the Coulomb pseudopotential (<sup>∗</sup> ൌ 0.10 െ 0.16 7,9) for which we used the mean value of <sup>∗</sup> ൌ 0.13 below. Derived ି can be compared with the value calculated by the first principles calculations.\n\nRecently, Pinsook and Tanthum 83 proposed that experimental ሺሻ can be fitted to the equation based on the Einstein temperature, Θா:\n\n$$R(T) = R\\_0 + A \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{\\Theta\\_E^2}{T}}{\\left(e^{\\frac{\\Theta\\_E}{T}} - 1\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{\\Theta\\_E}{T}}\\right)}\\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere , , and Θா are free-fitting parameters. Pinsook and Tanthum 83 found that the deduced Θா is approximately equal to the temperature <sup>ቀ</sup> <sup>ℏ</sup> ಳ ቁ associated with the logarithmically averaged characteristic frequency in the Allen-Dynes approximation 84,85 of the Eliashberg theory of electron-phonon superconductivity 86:\n\n$$T\\_c = \\frac{1}{1.20} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{k\\_B} \\omega\\_{ln}\\right) e^{\\left[-\\frac{1.04\\left(1+\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph} - \\mu^\\* \\left(1+0.62\\lambda\\_{e-ph}\\right)}\\right]} \\cdot f\\_1 \\cdot f\\_2 \\tag{7}$$\n\n$$f\\_1 = \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}}{2.46(1+3.8\\mu^\\*)}\\right)^{3/2}\\right)^{1/3} \\tag{8}$$\n\n$$f\\_2 = 1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(\\omega^2)^{1/2}}{\\omega\\_{\\rm ln}} - 1\\right) \\lambda\\_{e-ph}^2}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}^2 + \\left(1.62(1 + 6.3\\mu^\\*) \\left(\\frac{(\\omega^2)^{1/2}}{\\omega\\_{\\rm ln}}\\right)\\right)^2} \\tag{9}$$\n\n$$\\{\\langle\\omega^2\\rangle^{1/2} = \\frac{2}{\\lambda\\_{e-ph}}\\int\\_0^\\infty \\omega \\times a^2 \\times F(\\omega)d\\omega\\tag{10}$$\n\nIn 82,87 we proposed to replace Eqs. 8,9 by approximated Eq. 5, because the values of <sup>ଶ</sup> ൈ ሺሻ and can not be deduced from experimental ሺሻ datasets. Thus, we also used the following equation:\n\n$$T\\_c = \\frac{\\Theta\\_E}{1.20} e^{\\left[-\\frac{1.04\\left(1+\\lambda\\_{E-ph,E}\\right)}{\\lambda\\_{E-ph}-\\mu^\\*\\left(1+0.62\\lambda\\_{E-ph,E}\\right)}\\right]} \\cdot f\\_1 \\cdot f\\_2^\\* \\tag{11}$$\n\nfor the independent determination of the electron-phonon coupling constant, ି,ா, from the deduced Einstein temperature, Θா.\n\nIn this work we derived the ground state superconducting coherence length ሺ0ሻ from the fit of the upper critical field data ଶሺሻ dataset to the single-band analytical approximation88 for the Helfand-Werthamer theory 89:\n\n$$B\\_{c2}(T) = \\frac{\\phi\\_0}{2\\pi \\xi^2(0)} \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_c}\\right)^2}{1 + 0.42 \\times \\left(\\frac{T}{T\\_c}\\right)^{1.47}}\\right) \\tag{12}$$\n\nwhere is the superconducting flux quantum.\n\n# **III. Parameters of the BaH12 phase**\n\nTo determine the instrumental broadening of the XRD machine used in 68, we analyzed XRD scan for calibrated CeO2, which was kindly provided to us by D. Semenok 68. Data for CeO2 was procced by DIOPTAS 78 software. XRD peaks were fitted to the sum of gaussians:\n\n$$I(2\\theta) = A\\_{bg} + \\sum\\_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A\\_k}{w\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} \\times e^{-2\\frac{\\left(2\\theta - 2\\theta\\_{peak}\\right)^2}{w^2}},\\tag{13}$$\n\nwhere is the peak area, 2, is the peak position, ሺ2ሻ ൌ ටగ ଶ is peak integral breadth, and , 2,, and are-free fitting parameters. The background level, , was a manually adjusted parameter in each XRD fit in the DIOPTAS software 78 and it was a free fitting parameter in final fit in Origin software 90.\n\nDerived peaks breadth, ሺ2ሻ, were fitted to Caglioti equation 91:\n\n$$\\beta\\_{\\rm inst}(2\\theta) = \\sqrt{U \\cdot \\tan^2\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{2}\\right) + V \\cdot \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{2}\\right) + W},\\tag{14}$$\nwhere , , and are free-fitting parameters. Result of the fit is shown in Fig. 1, where derived parameters are: ൌ 0, V ൌ 0 , ൌ ሺ1.29 േ 0.06ሻ ൈ 10ି.\n\n![](0__page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1.** Experimental ሺሻ data for standard CeO2 sample. Raw XRD scan was provided by D. Semenok. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow area.\n\nPeaks in XRD scans of BaH12 were fitted to Eq. 13 and ௦௨ௗሺ2ሻ datasets were deduced. The peaks breadth originated from the BaH12 phase, ுଵଶሺ2ሻ, were calculated by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\beta\\_{BaH12}(2\\theta) = \\sqrt{\\beta\\_{measured}^2(2\\theta) - \\beta\\_{inst}^2(2\\theta)},\n\\tag{15}\n$$\n\nDerived ுଵଶሺ, ሻ datasets were fitted to the WH equation (Eq. 1). Deduced values from these fits, ሺሻ and ሺሻ, are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nOne can see (Fig. 2) that ሺሻ and ሺሻ are practically independent from applied pressure in the studied range of 126 160 . It is interesting to note, that highly compressed BaH12 has negligible level of micro-strain.\n\n![](0__page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Derived (a) grain size ሺሻ and (b) micro-strain ሺሻ in highly compressed BaH12. Raw XRD data was measured by Chen *et al*. 68. 95% confidence bands are shown by (a) cyan and (b) magenta shadow areas.\n\nIn Figures 3 and 4, we showed the ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ data measured in BaH12 by Chen *et al.* 68 and data fits to Bloch-Grüneisen (Eq. 2) and Einstein (Eq. 6) models in panels *a* and *b*, respectively. The substitution derived Θ and Θா in respectful equations returns the ି, and ି,ா values which appear to be practical equal to each other ି,ா ൌ ି, ≅ 0.71 (Fig. 3), and ି,ா ൌ 0.70 ≅ ି, ൌ 0.69 (Fig. 4). We also found that Θா⁄Θ ≅ 0.805 (Figs. 3,4), which is lower than the theoretical value of Θா⁄Θ ൌ 0.828. It should be noted that the\n\nobtained Θா⁄Θ ≅ 0.805 value is very close to the one deduced for highly compressed LaB2H8 87.\n\n![](0__page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3.** ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ dataset for BaH12 (heating #1) and data fit to (**a**) Bloch-Grüneisen (Eq. 2) and (**b**) Einstein (Eq. 6) models. Raw ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ data reported by Chen *et al*. 68. Derived parameters are shown in panels (**a**) and (**b**). Goodness of fit: (**a**) *R* = 0.9998 and (**b**) *R* = 0.9997. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow areas.\n\nMoreover, the derived values of ିሺ ൌ 100 ሻ ≅ 0.70 differs from the value ିሺ ൌ 140 ሻ ൌ 0.95 obtained by first principles calculations 68. Such a difference can originate from the difference in pressure used in experiment ( ൌ 100 ሻ and the one used for calculations ( ൌ 140 ሻ. Another probable reason is the presence of vacancies in the\n\ncrystalline structure of BaH12. Atomic-scale vacancies are now considered an important structural defect that can determine *T*c in high-pressure superconductors 35,92.\n\n![](0__page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 4.** ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ dataset for BaH12 (heating #2) and data fit to (**a**) Bloch-Grüneisen (Eq. 2) and (**b**) Einstein (Eq. 6) models. Raw ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ data reported by Chen *et al*. 68. Derived parameters are shown in panels (**a**) and (**b**). Goodness of fit: (**a**) *R* = 0.9998 and (**b**) *R* = 0.9997. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow areas.\n\n## **IV. Parameters of the BiH4 phase**\n\nIn Figure 5, we showed the ሺ, ൌ 172 ሻ data measured in BiH4 hydride by Shan *et al.*69. Data fits to Bloch-Grüneisen (Eq. 2) and Einstein (Eq. 6) models are shown in panels *a* and *b* of Fig. 5, respectively.\n\nTo calculate the ି, and ି,ா values we defined the transition temperature by a strict resistance criterion ோሺ்ୀ்ሻ ோೝ → 0.05. The substitution of the derived Θ and Θா in respectful equations returns the ି, and ି,ா values which appear to be equal to each other, ି,ா ൌ ି, ൌ 2.9 (Fig. 5), In addition, we found that the ratio Θா⁄Θ ൌ 0.822 (Fig. 5) is practically equal to the theoretical value of Θா⁄Θ ൌ 0.828.\n\n![](0__page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 5.** ሺ, ൌ 172 ሻ dataset for BiH4 and data fit to (**a**) Bloch-Grüneisen (Eq. 2) and (**b**) Einstein (Eq. 6) models. Raw ሺ, ൌ 100 ሻ data reported by Shan *et al.* 69. Derived parameters are shown in panels. Goodness of fit is *R* = 0.9998 for both panels. 95% confidence bands are shown by pink shadow areas.\n\nThe derived Θா⁄Θ values for BaH12 and BiH4 confirm the proposal by Pinsook and Tanthum83 that the Einstein temperature Θா can be used instead of the value <sup>ቀ</sup> <sup>ℏ</sup> ಳ ቁ in the Allen-Dynes equation85.\n\nConsidering results of the first-principles calculations by Ma *et al*. 70, we found that the closest theoretical ቀ <sup>ℏ</sup> ಳ ቁ value to our value Θாሺ ൌ 172 ሻ ൌ 406 (deduced from experimental ሺሻ) is ቀ <sup>ℏ</sup> ಳ ቁ ሺ ൌ 150 ሻ ൌ 507 calculated for *P21/m*-BiH2 phase. Moreover, the deduced ି,ாሺ172 ሻ ൌ ି,ሺ172 ሻ ൌ 2.9 is remarkably\n\ndifferent from the value calculated by first-principles calculations ି,ሺ170 ሻ ൌ 2.01 <sup>69</sup> and ି,ሺ150 ሻ 1.34 for BiH*n* (*n* = 2,3,4,5,6).\n\nSuch a large difference between the deduced ି from experimental ሺሻ (by utilizing two approaches Eqs. 2-11) and the calculated values by first-principles has not been reported before 83,93. Instead, it was shown a reasonable agreement between experimental and calculated values 83,93. Based on this, we can state that the deduced value of ିሺ172 ሻ ൌ 2.9 is correct.\n\nSuch a large difference should be commented. Our current interpretation of this difference is based on idea that some small part of the molecular hydrogen is actually dissociated at such high pressure of ൌ 172 . The possibility of partial dissociation of molecular hydrogen cannot be excluded, based on available literature which we reviewed in the *Introduction* part. If so, the dissociated hydrogen makes contribution in the phonon spectrum. This contribution distorts the phonon spectrum, and, perhaps, creates new bands in addition to the bands calculated to the date 69,70 in BiH4. In the result, the ି value can be enhanced in comparison with the ି, value, which is calculated based on the assumption that the real structure of the BiH4 is formed by bismuth and molecular hydrogen only69,70.\n\nIn Figure 6, we showed the upper critical field ଶሺሻ which was deduced from the\n\nሺ, , ൌ 172 ሻ data reported by Shan *et al.*69. For the derivation, we used the resistive\n\n![](0__page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 6.** ଶሺሻ for BiH4 and data fit Eq. 12. Raw ሺ, , ൌ 172 ሻ data reported by Shan *et al.*<sup>69</sup> ଶሺሻ datasets were derived by applying criterion ோሺ்ୀ்ሻ ோೝ ൌ 0.07. 95% confidence intervals are indicated by the pink shaded area.\n\nThe ground state coherence length, ሺ0ሻ ൌ 4.1 േ 0.1 was deduced from the ଶሺሻ fit to the Equation 12 (Figure 6). The deduced value was substituted in the Equation 11 to calculate the Fermi temperature:\n\n$$T\\_F = \\frac{\\pi^2 m\\_e}{8\\pi k\\_B} \\cdot \\left\\{ 1 + \\lambda\\_{e-ph} \\right\\} \\cdot \\xi^2(0) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{ak\\_B T\\_c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2,\\tag{16}$$\n\nwhere is bare electron mass, ℏ is reduced Planck constant, ൌ ଶሺሻ ಳ் , and ି ൌ 2.9 was taken from Fig. 5. The ଶሺሻ ಳ் ratio was calculated by linear approximated relation proposed in Ref.94:\n$$\n\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{2\\Lambda(0)}{k\\_B T\\_c} = 3.2\\dots 6.74 \\times \\lambda\\_{e-ph}. \\tag{17}\n$$\n\nCalculated ி ൌ 19,500 implies that the BiH4 falls between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot with ⁄ி ൌ 0.0044 (Fig. 7). This position is outside (towards the BCS superconductivity band) the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located (Fig. 7).\n\n![](1__page_14_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 7.** Uemura plot (*T*c vs. *T*F) where BiH4 phase is shown together with main superconducting families. References to the original data are in Refs.72,95–97. The position of the BiH4 phase is outside of the band, where other hydrogen-based superconductors are located, and toward the band of classical BCS superconductors.\n\nHowever, the most important finding in this work is the established ratio of Θ⁄ி ൌ 0.026 in BiH4 (Fig. 8). This value is similar to the Θ⁄ி in pure metals and A-15 alloys (Fig. 8). Thus, the BiH4 is the first discovered highly compressed high-*T*c superhydride 72,93,95,96 which complies 98–103 with the Migdal's theorem 104. This is unexpected result. Perhaps this result is additional evidence for the presence of the dissociated hydrogen in the structure of highly\n\ncompressed BiH4, because the metallization of the dissociated hydrogen should bust the Fermi surface size.\n\n![](1__page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 7.** ವ ்ಷ plot where BiH4 phase is shown together with main superconducting families. References to the original data are in Refs.72,93,95,96.\n\n## **V. Conclusions**\n\nIn this study, we analysed available experimental data reported for highly compressed molecular hydrides BaH12 68 and BiH4 69.\n\nIn the result, we confirm that the proposal by Pinsook and Tanthum 83 that the Einstein temperature Θா can be used instead of the <sup>ቀ</sup> <sup>ℏ</sup> ಳ ቁ term in the Allen-Dynes equation 85.\n\nOne of the central findings of our study is that the BiH4 exhibits a low level of nonadiabaticity, Θ⁄ி ൌ 0.026, and, thus, the BiH4 is the first hydride which complies with Migdal theorem 104.\n\nWe have proposed that the BiH4 samples at ൌ 172 contain some hydrogen in dissociated metallized state.\n\n## **Acknowledgements**\n\nThe authors thanks Dr. Dmitrii Semenok (Center for High Pressure Science & Technology)\n\nfor providing raw experimental data for molecular hydride BaH12 68 and for consultations in\n\nregard of DIOPTAS software.

        "abstract": "The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently, the third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and BiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that the BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa < P < 160 GPa. We also derived the Debye $Θ_D$ and Einstein $Θ_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant $Λ_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $Λ_{e-ph} $ in BiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles calculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $Θ_D / T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.",
