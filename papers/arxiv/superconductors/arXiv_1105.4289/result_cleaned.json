This value agrees well with the trend established by Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield who found that ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ aT<sup>c</sup> 2 for 14 examples of doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 and BaFe2-xTMxAs2, where the transition metal TM=Co and Ni. We extend their analysis to include all the FePn/Ch superconductors for which ∆C/Tc is currently known and find ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ aT<sup>c</sup> 1.9 and a=0.083 mJ/molK<sup>4</sup> . A comparison with the elemental superconductors with Tc>1 K and with A-15 superconductors shows that, contrary to the FePn/Ch superconductors, electron-phonon-coupled conventional superconductors exhibit a significantly different dependence of ∆C on Tc, namely ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 0.9. However ∆C/γTc appears to be comparable in all three classes (FePn/Ch, elemental and A-15) of superconductors with, e. g., ∆C/γTc=2.4 for BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2. A discussion of the possible implications of these phenomenological comparisons for the unconventional superconductivity believed to exist in the FePn/Ch is given.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n In the ongoing study of superconductivity in the FePn/Ch, only a few examples have been found where the preponderance of the evidence argues for nodes in the superconducting gap. Among these, overdoped BaFe2-xCoxAs2, Tc =8.1 K, is believed to be a nodal superconductor based on thermal conductivity as a function of magnetic field, κ(H), data.[1] Based on penetration depth [2], nuclear magnetic resonance [3], κ(H) [2], and as yet unpublished specific heat vs H data[4], BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 is also believed to be a nodal superconductor.\n\nHerein we report measurements of the discontinuity in the specific heat, ∆C, divided by Tc in BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 at the superconducting transition temperature (T<sup>c</sup> mid=28.2 K) which, due to the high temperature and necessity for precision measurement because of the large phonon contribution (>90% of CTotal), has not previously been reported. Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield (hereafter 'BNC') have pointed out [5], in a sampling of 14 doped BaFe2As2 FePn superconductors, that ∆C/Tc has an unusual dependence on Tc, namely ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 2 . Our data for BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 are discussed in this framework; as well, an expansion of this discussion to include conventional electron-phonon coupled and several representative heavy Fermion superconductors is included for comparison. Finally, since the specific heat γ (limit of C/T as T→0) of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 is known from measurements [4] of the specific heat up to 35 T (2/3 of Hc2(0)), the normalized ∆C/γTc is also discussed and compared with other FePn/Ch and conventional superconductors where γ has been reported.\n\n## **Experimental**\n\nThe specific heat of a 40 mg piece of high purity (99.9985 %) platinum from Alfa Aesar, which has approximately the same specific heat as the 18.2 mg collage of crystals of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 at 30 K, was first measured using established time constant methods.[6] In the\n\ntemperature range of measurement, the measured specific heat of the Pt standard was within ±1% of published values. The single crystals used for the collage of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 were prepared as discussed in [7], and were the same as used in our other specific heat measurements.[4,8]\n\n## **Results and Discussion**\n\nThe specific heat of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 from 19 to 32 K is shown in Fig. 1. The transition\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1 (color online) Specific heat in the neighborhood of the superconducting transition in BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2. The precision and the absolute error of the data, ±1%, is approximately the size of the data points. The sloped red lines are fits to the data above and below the transition, while the vertical red line marks an ideal, sharp discontinuity at T<sup>c</sup> mid=28.2 K.\n\nwidth of ≈1.3 K for the bulk specific heat measurement is not dissimilar to the magnetic susceptibility result[3] although the T<sup>c</sup> onset determined from susceptibility is approximately 30 K.\n\nThe measured ∆C/Tc is 38.5 ± 2 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> , which agrees well with the trend in ∆C/Tc vs Tc established by BNC and is compared to other FePh/Ch superconductors in Fig. 2. Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield [5] presented data for their specific heat results on Co- and Ni-doped BaFe2As2,\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFig. 2 (color online) log∆C/Tc vs logTc for conventional superconductors (elements with Tc>1 K in black solid circles and representative A-15 compounds in blue open squares), for FePn/Ch superconductors, and for some representative heavy Fermion superconductors (red X's) which, due to the lower Tc's and higher ∆C's involved are plotted vs the red right hand and upper axes with different scales. The slope of the black elemental superconductor line gives ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 0.94 , for the A-15 superconductors the dotted blue best fit line gives ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 0.82, while the magenta\n\ndashed line for the FePn/Ch gives ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ 0.083T<sup>c</sup> 1.89. A-15 Nb3Ge, which has a rather broad transition that is difficult to extrapolate to an idealized, sharp transition, is not plotted. In order to focus on the FePn/Ch results, the labels for the A-15 and heavy Fermions are mostly omitted. However, Table 1 lists the detailed data values and references for all the plotted points. The heavy Fermion compounds, which are likely unconventional superconductors, surprisingly show ∆C/Tc vs Tc behavior similar to the elemental and A-15 superconductors, with ∆C/Tc roughly varying as T<sup>c</sup> 0.7. This type of plot, with data for the early results in FePn for doped BaFe2As2, was first proposed by Bud'ko, Ni, and Canfield.[5]\n\nas well as literature data for Ba(Fe0.939Co0.061)2As2, Ba0.55K0.45Fe2As2 and Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, see Fig. 2. In addition, we show more recent data on other FePn/Ch, all the superconducting elements with Tc>1 K, a broad selection of A-15 superconductors in order to extend the Tc range higher to overlap more with the FePn/Ch, and several heavy Fermion superconductors to also provide a comparison to known unconventional superconductors. The respective ∆C/Tc and T<sup>c</sup> values are shown in Table 1. The gamma values for the elemental superconductors are bounded by around 10 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> (V and La) [6], while γ values for the A-15's can be several times larger (see references in Table 1). The slopes of the two ∆C/Tc vs Tc sets of data in Fig. 2 for these two classes of conventional, electron-phonon coupled superconductors are clearly quite close, and in strong contrast to the slope for the FePn/Ch.\n\n The data shown in Fig. 2 for the FePn/Ch are complete with three exceptions. The value [9-10] (not shown) for KFe2As2, where for a high quality (residual resistivity ratio ≈ 650) sample [10] ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ≈ 41 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> at T<sup>c</sup> mid=3.1 K, lies far above the FePn/Ch behavior and seems consistent with the A-15 line. This deviation - together with other properties of KFe2As2 such as lack of Fermi surface nesting, atypical pnictogen height vs Tc behavior, and low Hc2 (for a review, see [11]) - argues that superconductivity in KFe2As2 may be different from that observed in the other FePn/Ch shown in Fig. 2. For LaFePO, the result [12] that ∆C/Tc ≈ 3 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> , Tc mid ≈ 5.5 K (which agrees with the FePn/Ch trend shown in Fig. 2) is also not shown in Fig. 2 since not only is the sample only partially superconducting (C/T does not trend to 0 below Tc), but at least one work [13] has argued that stoichiometric LaFePO is non-superconducting. Recently, the first ∆C/Tc data have become available [66] for the new KxFe2-ySe2, Tc≈32 K, superconductor which – in contrast to the other FePn/Ch superconductors – appears to lack hole pockets at the Fermi surface as well as being much less metallic. Whether the large deviation in this new material's ∆C/Tc, reported to be ≈12 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> , from the BNC trend shown in Fig. 2 is intrinsic or due to sample quality must await further work and is therefore not included in the plot here.\n\n Zaanen [14] has proposed that this ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 2 scaling behavior argues against a Fermi liquid picture, and instead discusses the idea that the superconductivity could be forming from a non-Fermi liquid quantum critical metal. Rather than the usual [15] quantum critical *point* in a phase diagram, Zaanen argues for a quantum critical *region* over some fraction of the superconducting dome in composition space. It is certainly true that several FePn/Ch show non-Fermi liquid behavior in their resistivities, e. g. P-doped BaFe2As2 [7] (whose ∆C/Tc is shown in Fig. 1), Co-doped BaFe2As2 [16], and FeSe [17] exhibit ρ=ρ0+AT<sup>1</sup> while LiFeAs shows [18] ρ=ρ0+ AT1.5. However, the question of non-Fermi liquid behavior is open for the great majority of the FePn/Ch whose ∆C/Tc's are summarized in Fig. 2. To explain the observed BNC scaling Kogan [19] considers instead that the FePn/Ch superconductors are weak coupled Fermi liquids with strong pair breaking, with the observed ∆C's and Tc's much reduced from those in hypothetical clean material.\n\n Looking at the trends brought out in Fig. 2 in a more phenomenological way, this sort of BNC plot makes clear that whatever the pairing mechanism in the superconducting state in the FePn/Ch is, that this superconductivity is different in a fundamental fashion from conventional superconductivity. Conventional electron-phonon coupled elemental and A-15 superconductors have a ∆C/Tc that is dependent [20] on three factors: the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy, N(0), the spectral density α 2 F(ω) and the Coulomb pseudopotential µ \\* . This dependence, using the slopes of the fits of ∆C/Tc to T<sup>c</sup> α in Fig. 2, says that for such superconductors a.) these three factors combine to give ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ Tc and b.) since in conventional superconductors experimental values for ∆C/Tc roughly vary [21] as γ (∆C/γTc=1.43 in weak coupling Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer, BCS, theory), Tc then (broadly speaking) must vary as γ, which is proportional to N(0)(1+λel-ph). Thus, for conventional elemental and A-15 superconductors we find in Fig. 2 that ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ Tc and - since experimentally [21] and according to BCS theory ∆C/Tc ∝ γ - therefore T<sup>c</sup> ∝ γ ∝ N(0)(1+λel-ph). (In weak coupling BCS theory, T<sup>c</sup> ∝ exp(-1/N(0)V).) This roughly linear phenomenological relation between Tc and the renormalized density of states in conventional superconductors that results from the plot in Fig. 2 is of course the paradigm that drove the search for higher Tc in the A-15 superconductors, with some success. It is also the paradigm that Bednorz and Mueller ignored to discover unconventional high Tc superconductivity in the low density of state perovskite-structure cuprates.\n\n Now, the BNC plot, updated in Fig. 2 in the present work, suggests another paradigm, namely that whatever instead of (or in addition to) N(0), α 2 F(ω), and µ \\* determines ∆C/Tc for the FePn/Ch, the result is that ∆C/Tc varies approximately as T<sup>c</sup> 2 in these new superconductors.\n\nAnother difference for the FePn/Ch is that although ∆C/Tc – in so far as γ values are known – remains [22] approximately proportional to γ, the measured γ's combined with calculations imply that γ for the FePn/Ch comes primarily from N(0)(1+λel-el) since λel-ph is negligible [23]. Thus, since for the FePn/Ch ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 2 and ∆C/Tc ∝ γ ∝ N(0)(1+λel-el), the BNC plot has implications for how the superconducting transition temperature Tc in FePn/Ch depends on the *electron-electron interactions* that are presumably involved in the superconducting pairing.\n\n It is also interesting to note the behavior, see Fig. 2 and Table 1, for several heavy Fermion superconductors: CeIrIn5 and CeCoIn5 (both non-Fermi liquid systems and both believed to have unconventional superconductivity (d-wave gap for CeCoIn5), see Pfleiderer [61]), CeCu2Si2 and UBe13. Their ∆C/Tc vs Tc slope shows a similar behavior to the conventional elemental and A-15 superconductors, thus the FePn/Ch present *another kind* of unconventional superconductivity than the heavy Fermion's. The further question – what about ∆C/Tc vs Tc for the cuprates – runs into complications caused by the pseudogap behavior with, e. g., various compositions near x=0.2 in La1-xSrxCuO4 having [65] similar Tc's and much different ∆C's.\n\n## **Summary and Conclusions:**\n\nThe specific heat jump at the superconducting transition, ∆C, has been measured for BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2. Normalized as ∆C/Tc, the result (38.5 ± 2 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> ) follows the phenomenological result of Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield (BNC) for 14 doped BaFe2Ass that ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> varies approximately as T<sup>c</sup> 2 . The present work has widened the comparison to include eight other FePn/Ch and finds that the BNC ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ aT<sup>c</sup> α (α=1.89±0.1, a=0.083 mJ/molK3.89) correlation still holds. In order to investigate this correlation, comparisons to elemental and A-\n15 superconductors, as well as the unconventional heavy Fermion superconductors, were presented. Both the conventional superconductors and the heavy Fermion superconductors exhibit an entirely different dependence, namely ∆C/T<sup>c</sup> ∝ T<sup>c</sup> 0.7-0.9, i. e. the FePn/Ch are clearly following a different dependence than these other superconductors. A heuristic argument, based on the facts that a.) *all* of the aforementioned superconductors appear to approximately follow ∆C/γT<sup>c</sup> ∝ constant and b.) the specific heat γ (≡C/T as T→0) is proportional to the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy, N(0), times (1+λel-ph+λel-el), is advanced that the different dependence of ∆C/Tc on Tc in the FePn/Ch yields information on the dependence of Tc on λel-el in these iron containing superconductors.\n\nAcknowledgements: Work at Florida performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy, contract no.

For the A-15 superconductors, ∆C/γTc varies between 1.5 for Ti3Sb to about 2.1 for Nb3Al, see the respective references given in Table 1\n\n[22] γ values to match with the ∆C/Tc values for the FePn/Ch are somewhat rare, since for Tc's above 10 K the extrapolation of the normal state C/T to T=0 to obtain γ (≡C/T for T→0) is difficult. In addition to the value of ∆C/γTc for the present work of 38.5/16=2.4 (gamma from [4, 8], values of γ are known for Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (γ=49 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> , Kant Ch, Deisenhofer J, Günther A, Schrettle F, Loidl A, Rotter M and Johrendt D 2010 *Phys. Rev.* B **81** 014529) to give ∆C/γTc from 2.04 to 2.36 and for annealed optimally doped BaFe1.85Co0.16As2 (γ=22 mJ/molK<sup>2</sup> , Gofryk K, Sefat A S, McGuire M A, Sales B C, Mandrus D, Imai T, Thompson J D, Bauer E D and Ronning F 2011 *J. Phys.: Conf. Ser.* **273** 012094) to give ≈1.5 for ∆C/γTc. Thus, for FePn/Ch systems where γ has been determined, ∆C/γTc is comparable to that found for conventional superconductors.\n\n[23] Boeri L, Dolgov O V and Golubov A A 2009 *Physica* C **469** 628; Subedi A, Zhang L, Singh D J and Du M H 2008 *Phys.

This value agrees well with the trend established by Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield, who found that \\Delta C/T_{ {c}} \\propto aT_{ {c}}^{2} for 14 examples of doped Ba<SUB>1 - x</SUB>K<SUB>x</SUB>Fe<SUB>2</SUB>As<SUB>2</SUB> and BaFe<SUB>2 - x</SUB>TM<SUB>x</SUB>As<SUB>2</SUB>, where the transition metal TM = Co and Ni. We extend their analysis to include all the FePn/Ch superconductors for which ΔC/T<SUB>c</SUB> is currently known and find \\Delta C/T_{ {c}} \\propto aT_{ <P />{c}}^{1.9} and a = 0.083 mJ mol<SUP> - 1</SUP> K<SUP> - 4</SUP>. A comparison with the elemental superconductors with T<SUB>c</SUB> > 1 K and with A-15 superconductors shows that, contrary to the FePn/Ch superconductors, electron-phonon-coupled conventional superconductors exhibit a significantly different dependence of ΔC on T<SUB>c</SUB>, namely \\Delta C/T_{ {c}} \\propto T_{ {c}}^{0.9} . However ΔC/γT<SUB>c</SUB> appears to be comparable in all three classes (FePn/Ch, elemental and A-15) of superconductors with, for example, ΔC/γT<SUB>c</SUB> = 2.4 for BaFe<SUB>2</SUB>(As<SUB>0.7</SUB>P<SUB>0.3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>. A discussion of the possible implications of these phenomenological comparisons for the unconventional superconductivity believed to exist in the FePn/Ch is given.",
