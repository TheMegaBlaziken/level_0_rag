T he valence/conduction band states were treated sem irelativistically (no spin-orbite ects)w hilethecorestates were treated fully relativistically. C are was taken to ensure appropriate k-point convergence for the accuracy needed in these studies.\n\nU sually it is found that the elastic constants, when evaluated at the experim entalvolum e,are w ithin 5-10% ofthe experim entalvalues.[\\[5](#page-3-0)]For a cubic system (such asthe A 15)to be m echanically stable,the bulk m odulus (B C <sup>11</sup> + 2C <sup>12</sup> 3 ) and shear elastic constants (C<sup>11</sup> C<sup>12</sup> and C44)m ustbe positive.T he overallphonon spectrum m ustbe stable aswell(positive square frequencies).T he elastic constants can be extracted using the procedures discussed by M ehletal.:[\\[5](#page-3-0)](i)calculate the totalenergy as a function ofthe volum e,and then \f t the results to an equation-of-state to extractthe bulk m odulusB ;\n\n![](_page_0_Figure_13.jpeg)\n\nFIG .1.

A rrow s denote allowed internal degrees offreedom (direction ofsublattice relaxations) in the tetragonally distorted A 15 structure.\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>(ii) apply an appropriate strain to the lattice to distort the prim itive lattice vectors, calculate the total energy versus strain at volume V , and determ ine the secondorder elastic constants from the coe cient second order in the strain. For example, using an orthorhom bic distortion, the distortion energy is,\n\n$$\\to \\begin{pmatrix} \\cdot & \\end{pmatrix} = \\nabla \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbb{C}\\_{11} & \\mathbb{C}\\_{12} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top} + \\mathcal{O} \\begin{pmatrix} \\ \\ \\end{pmatrix} : \\tag{7}$$\n\nW e can thus extract C 11 C 12 from Eq. (1). Sim ilarly, we used a m onoclinic distortion to extract C 44 .\n\nOur calculated total energies of V3Si, V3Ge, and N b3 Sn in the A 15 structure as a function of volum e, were used to extract the equilibrium volum es and bulk m oduli of these materials. The calculated equilibrium volum es are underestim ated by 4-6% , typical of LD A calculations, leading to the calculated equilibrium bulk moduli being overestim ated com pared to experim ent by m ore than 25% . On the other hand, the calculated bulk m oduli at the experim ental volum es are very close ( 5% ) to those ofexperim ent, as shown in Table I.\n\nNext, we exam ined the stability of the A 15 m aterials under the application of shears corresponding to the elastic constants C11 C12 and C44, rst without allow ing the cell-internal.sublattice displacem.ents that are allow ed by the broken sym m etries produced by the elastic distortions. Figure 2 depicts our calculated distortion energies (open squares) as a finction of 2 using orthorhom bically distorted cells. For a perfectly ham onic crystal, the data points would fall on a straight line, with the slopes given by C 12 . Indeed the calculated points fall quite close to straight lines, indicating only sm all contributions from higher order term s [0 ( \" ) ]. The tted C11 C 12 and C 44 values, shown in Table I, are very close to the experim ental room tem perature values, rather than to the low tem perature values as might be expected for a typical m aterial. Since rst-principle calculations are supposed to correspond to T = 0, not to high tem peratures, why don't we reproduce the soft elastic constants seen at low tem perature?\n\nT his puzzle was solved by realizing that as one distorts a crystal from a higher to a low er sym metry space group, new internaldegrees offreedom could be introduced with signi cant physicaland com putationalim portance, especially for system s w ith lattice instabilities. W e note that it is tem pting to overlook these sublattice distortions because determ ining their e ect introduces a large increase in the computational burden, since for each internal distortion a set of self-consistent calculations needs to be perform ed to nd the equilibrium sublattice distortions corresponding to the volum e and strain under investigation.\n\nFor the orthornom bically distorted A 15 cell, the sublattice displacem ents correspond to pairs of A atom s m oving tow ard or aw ay from each other (rather than xing on their sym m etry m andated A 15 positions), but\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\nF IG . 2 . D istortion energies for orthorhom bically distorted A 15 structure. Calculations were perform ed at the experim ental A 15 volum es. The open squares denote calculation perform ed with A 15-like internal coordinates, while lled circles denote calculations with internal coordinates fully relaxed .\n\ndi erent pairs move independently. Thus, we need to add (iii) sublattice relaxation into our above procedures for calculating elastic constants. A fter fully relaxing the sublattices, we have found that the relaxed distortion energies for the A 15 com pounds (denoted by lled circles in Figure 2) are lowered by a substantial am ount, which increases as the distortion gets larger. The relaxed distortion energies show a m inim um around 1 { 2% and even dip below the energies of the \\ ideal\" cubic A 15 structure. Hence, these three A 15 com pounds are intrinsically unstable in the cubic structure at T = 0. N ote that the C 11 C 12 instability appears to be weakest in V 3G e. A gain, the weakest C 44 instability occurs in V 3G e, while the strongest instability occurs for N b3Sn, as seen in experim ent (Table I) .\n\nAn altemative way to obtain C 11 C 12 is to distort the cell tetragonally. This tetragonally distorted cell turns out to have the sam e structure as the observed tetraqonal phase [6] for some A 15 com pounds (Fig. 1). The distortion energies are depicted as a function of distortion ( = § 1) in Fig. 3. Ifw e freeze the atom s in their A 15-like coordinates, the calculated sublattice-unrelaxed distortion energies (denoted by open squares) fall quite closely on a parabola. Note that the distortion energy\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>contains odd term s ofdistortion = c a 1 rather than being an even function of as in the case oforthorhom bic and m onoclinic distortions,so thatwe needed to perform m ore \f rst-principles calculations (for ) for this case.Indeed,we see a slightasym m etry aboutthe = 0 axis,indicating a sm allcubic term [O ( <sup>3</sup>)]. Least-square\n\n\f tting these data to the form a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + c4,we can extractC<sup>11</sup> C<sup>12</sup> = 3a=V .Such \f tted C<sup>11</sup> C<sup>12</sup> valuesare w ithin 6% ofthose show n in Table [I](#page-4-0)using orthorhom bically distorted cells.\n\nN ext we allowed the internalcoordinates to relax in a m anner consistent w ith the tetragonalstructure,and found thatthedistortion energieswerelowered by a large am ount,show ing a double wellstructure w ith respectto c a . In the case ofV3Si,the m inim um occurs for <sup>c</sup> a > 1, w hile for N b3Sn the m inim um occurs for <sup>c</sup> a < 1, in agreem ent w ith experim entalobservations [\\[1](#page-3-0)]. For the case of V3G e,we \f nd an extrem ely shallow welland a m uch weaker instability (bordering on the accuracy of our LA PW calculations). T herefore,a sm allam ount of sam ple im perfection, such as im purities, vacancies, or disorder,or therm ale ects,could inhibit the transition from occurring in V3G e. Experim entally, no cubic-totetragonalphase transition has been observed for V3G e, although there issom e evidence foranom aliesin itselastic constants [\\[7](#page-3-0)].\n\nForV3Siand N b3Sn,thedetailsofthestructuralphase transitions are very sensitive functions ofsam ple conditions, w ith, for instance, the observed <sup>c</sup> a ratios, varying from 0.9964 to 0.9938 for N b3Sn and approxim ately 1.0024 forV3Si,[\\[1\\]](#page-3-0),w hilethecalculated m inim um occurs at <sup>c</sup> a about 1.02 and 0.985 for V3Siand N b3Sn,respectively, signi\f cantly larger than experim ent. Since the relaxed distortion energy curves are very sm alland the curvesarevery \nat,a precisedeterm ination ofthe<sup>c</sup> a ratio is di cult, although m ost of the quantitative disagreem entbetween theory and experim entcan be ascribed to LD A errors that do not a ect the conclusions regarding the instabilities that we are focusing on.\n\nW eseefrom theseresultsthatthekey to understanding the elastic constant softening,and m ost probably other anom alous properties in the A 15 m aterials,is the relaxation of the internaldegrees of freedom (sublattice relaxation) w hen there are celldistortions,w hich leads to highly anharm onic behavior in the A 15's,generalideas put forward by Testardi.[\\[8](#page-3-0)]A thigh tem peratures,therm alm otion washes away the wellstructure and atom s spend the m ajority of their tim e away from the \nat wellm inim a and assum e \\average\" A 15 positions. C alculations w ith \\frozen-in\" A 15-like coordinates give the m axim um attainable elastic constants,w hich correspond closely to the experim entalroom tem perature values.A s the tem perature is lowered, the e ect of sublattice relaxation sets in, and at T = 0, these A 15 com pounds are intrinsically unstable w ith respect to C<sup>11</sup> C<sup>12</sup> and C<sup>44</sup> shear distortions. T hese results can be interpreted\n\nin term s ofa ferroelastic type ofinstability as discussed by M iller and A xe [\\[13](#page-3-0)],w ith exam ples given in the book ofSilje.[\\[14\\]](#page-3-0)\n\nW e have seen thatthe \f rst-principleselectronic structure m ethod predictsthe existence ofelastic constantinstabilitiesand the cubic to tetragonalphase transition in A 15 m aterials.Itisalso wellestablished thatthe overall phonon spectra of m any of the A 15's exhibits unusual tem perature dependencies and selected softening in different parts of the Brillouin Zone [\\[6,9,10\\]](#page-3-0). Such instabilities for the phonons also follow from our calculations using thefrozen phonon m ethod w hich wehaveapplied to determ ine the zone-center optic phonons. N ote that the relaxed distortion energy in Fig.3(c) for N b3Sn at = 0 ( c a = 1) has a sm allnegative value of 4 m eV /cell, indicating an unstable zonecenter12 phonon,since this phonon has the sam e space group as the tetragonally distorted A 15 cell, but w ith c a. T he calculation for the <sup>2</sup> phonon (pairs of A atom s m ove toward or away from each other w ith the sam e displacem ents for allthree orthogonalchains)also show s a sm all,negative phonon energy forN b3Sn,indicating an instability. C alculationsforthe <sup>12</sup> and <sup>2</sup> phononsforV3Siand V3G e also show anom alies. H owever,for these m aterials these phonons have negative or very sm all positive energies, e.g.,their phonon energies are less than 1 m eV /cellfor the <sup>12</sup> phonon at a displacem ent of0:003a,w here a is the cubic lattice constant. For com parison,zone center phonon energies at the sam e displacem ent for a typical interm etallic com pound such as C u3Pt in the cubic L1<sup>2</sup> structureare 25 m eV /cell(w heretheunitcellcontains\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\nFIG .3.

Note that since we estim ate the accuracy of our LAP W calculations for phonon energies to be approxim ately 2 m eV /cell, we can argue that the zone center phonons 12 and 2 are extrem ely soft at best, and are on the borderline of being stable or unstable.\n\nF irst-principles electronic structure calculations have shown that the DOS near Er for V3Siand Nb3Sn have very sharp structures, [11,12] in qualitative agreem ent with early model calculations of the DOS, and we nd sim ilar results here. W hat is particularly interesting, how ever, is that we nd explicitly that the D O S singularities, and the associated Ferm i surface nesting features, are rem oved follow ing the sublattice distortions and the resultant structural phase transitions. We w ill discuss this more fully in a future publication .\n\nIn summ ary, it appears that m any of the unusualproperties of the A 15 m aterials are describable in term s of \\standard\" LDA electronic structure calculations when sublattice relaxation e ects are included. W e have show n that the A 15 m aterials (V 3Si, V 3G e, and N b3Sn) are intrinsically unstable against shears producing the moduli C11 C12 and C44, at T = 0. Our calculations also indicate that the zone center phonons ( 2 and 12 ) are either unstable or extrem ely soft at T = 0. Sim ilar studies of the full phonon spectrum and the superconducting tunneling functions for the A 15 m aterials are being form ulated to verify whether the \\standard\" LD A m ethods are consistent with all of the experim ental data.\n\nA s a word of caution, we urge that elastic stability of a \\com puter-designed\" novel m aterial should alw ays be checked, as one w ould not have anticipated the calculated instabilities in the A 15 m aterials by exam ining the total energy verses volum e curves alone.\n\nThe authors appreciate helpful discussions with M .
